# Gemini Agent Instructions

Read AGENTS.md for project structure and key information.
Read plan.md for the implementation plan and success criteria.

## Critical Constraint
All code must be written by agents via `gt` commands. Do not write code directly.

## Your Role
You are working on a Gas Town rig. Use `gt` commands to:
- Create beads via Mayor (`gt mayor attach`)
- Dispatch work (`gt sling <bead> $RIG_NAME`)
- Monitor progress (`gt ready --rig $RIG_NAME`)
