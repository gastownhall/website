Welcome to Gas Town.md\n2. The Future of Coding Agents.md\n3. BAGS and the Creator Economy.md\n4. Gas Town Emergency User Manual.md\n5. Stevey's Birthday Blog.md\n\n### Docs to Shred (from `docs-fodder/gastown-docs/`)\n- 25 markdown files organized into concepts/, design/, examples/\n- Need a shredder script to sync these into the website\n\n## Social Links\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/xHpUGUzZp2\n- X: x.com/gastownhall\n\n## Landing Page Headline\n\"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n```\n\n**CLAUDE.md** - Claude agent instructions:\n```markdown\n# Claude Agent Instructions\n\nRead AGENTS.md for project structure and key information.\nRead plan.md for the implementation plan and success criteria.\n\n## Critical Constraint\nAll code must be written by agents via `gt` commands. Do not write code directly.\n\n## Your Role\nYou are working on a Gas Town rig. Use `gt` commands to:\n- Create beads via Mayor (`gt mayor attach`)\n- Dispatch work (`gt sling <bead> $RIG_NAME`)\n- Monitor progress (`gt ready --rig $RIG_NAME`)\n```\n\n**GEMINI.md** - Gemini agent instructions:\n```markdown\n# Gemini Agent Instructions\n\nRead AGENTS.md for project structure and key information.\nRead plan.md for the implementation plan and success criteria.\n\n## Critical Constraint\nAll code must be written by agents via `gt` commands. Do not write code directly.\n\n## Your Role\nYou are working on a Gas Town rig. Use `gt` commands to:\n- Create beads via Mayor (`gt mayor attach`)\n- Dispatch work (`gt sling <bead> $RIG_NAME`)\n- Monitor progress (`gt ready --rig $RIG_NAME`)\n```\n\n### Step 0.2: Add Rig to Gas Town\n\n**Existing HQ**: `~/gt/` is already initialized (daemon, deacon, mayor, dartantic rig exist)\n\n**Project**: Use the origin of the current working directory (supports multiple forks)\n\n### Steps (all commands run from cwd - no `cd` needed)\n\n```bash\n# Get the git remote URL and derive a rig name from the current project\nORIGIN=$(git remote get-url origin)\nRIG_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))  # e.g., \"website-eli\" from the folder name\n\n# 1. Add this project as a new rig (uses origin from current directory)\ngt rig add $RIG_NAME $ORIGIN --prefix $RIG_NAME\n\n# 2. Verify setup\ngt doctor --rig $RIG_NAME\ngt rig status $RIG_NAME\n```\n\n**Note**: Each agent works on their own copy of the repo (e.g., `gastown/website-eli`, `gastown/website-cc`). The rig name and prefix are derived from the project folder name to avoid conflicts.\n\n`gt rig add` clones the repo into `~/gt/$RIG_NAME/` and initializes:\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `.beads/` - Already initialized with prefix `$RIG_NAME`\n- `crew/`, `polecats/`, `witness/` - Agent directories\n\n### Learning: Document what `gt rig add` creates and how it differs from `gt init`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create the Project Plan via Mayor\n\n### Approach: Mayor-driven planning (gt-native workflow)\n\nThe `gt` workflow is centered on the Mayor handling bead creation. Instead of manually running `bd create`, we describe requirements to the Mayor and let it file beads.\n\n```bash\ngt mayor attach\n```\n\nThen describe the full requirements to Mayor:\n\n```\nI need to build the gastownhall.ai website with the following components:\n\nLANDING PAGE:\n- Hero section with headline: \"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n- Links to Steve's 5 blog posts (see docs-fodder/steve-blog-posts/)\n- Big Discord invite CTA button (https://discord.gg/xHpUGUzZp2)\n- X link (x.com/gastownhall)\n- Navigation to docs\n\nDOCS SYSTEM:\n- Docs landing page showing overview + links to all sub-pages\n- Docs shredder script that syncs docs-fodder/gastown-docs/ into the website\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE:\n- Plausible analytics integration\n- robots.txt\n- llms.txt generator script\n- SEO meta tags on all pages\n- Privacy policy page\n\nBUILD SYSTEM:\n- Astro project scaffold\n- Build scripts for src/ → deploy/\n\nPlease create an epic hierarchy for this with appropriate beads filed in rig $RIG_NAME.\nShow me the bead IDs when done.\n```\n\n### Alternative: Formulas for reusable workflows\n\nIf we want to define a reusable workflow pattern:\n```bash\ngt formula create mol-website-feature --type=workflow\n# Mayor edits the formula\ngt formula show mol-website-feature\n```\n\n### Learning: Document how Mayor files beads and manages dependencies\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Work Breakdown Structure\n\n**Note**: Bead IDs use the rig's prefix (e.g., `website-eli-landing` if `$RIG_NAME=website-eli`). Below shows the suffix pattern - actual IDs will be `$RIG_NAME-<suffix>`.\n\n### Epic: Landing Page (`$RIG_NAME-landing`)\n| Bead Suffix | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| `landing-hero` | Hero section with headline \"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic.

Bead IDs include the prefix (e.g., `website-eli-landing`).\n\n### Create convoy for tracking (town-level, works from any directory)\n```bash\ngt convoy create \"Website v1\" $RIG_NAME-landing $RIG_NAME-docs $RIG_NAME-infra $RIG_NAME-build --notify overseer\n```\n\n### Dispatch in dependency order (specify rig as target)\n\n1. **Foundation** (must complete first):\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-astro-scaffold $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-docs-shredder $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n2. **Landing page** (can parallelize):\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-landing-hero $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-landing-blog-links $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-landing-cta $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-landing-nav $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n3. **Docs pages**:\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-docs-landing $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n4. **Infrastructure**:\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-analytics $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-robots $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-llms-txt $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-seo $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-privacy-policy $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n5. **Build scripts**:\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-build-scripts $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n### Monitor progress (all gt commands, no `cd` needed)\n```bash\ngt convoy list                    # Dashboard view of all convoys\ngt convoy status <convoy-id>      # Specific convoy details\ngt rig status $RIG_NAME           # Rig-specific worker status\ngt ready --rig $RIG_NAME          # Ready work in this rig\ngt show <bead-id>                 # Details of a specific bead\n```\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Test and Review\n\n### Testing beads - via Mayor\n```bash\ngt mayor attach\n```\nThen ask:\n```\nCreate test beads for the website in rig $RIG_NAME:\n- Test: Build process works\n- Test: All internal links work\n- Test: All external links work\n- Test: Responsive design\n- Test: Basic accessibility\n\nThen create a convoy for these tests and sling them.\n```\n\nAlternatively, dispatch test work directly:\n```bash\ngt convoy create \"Website Tests\" $RIG_NAME-test-* --notify overseer\ngt sling $RIG_NAME-test-build $RIG_NAME\n```\n\n### Code review via Crew\n```bash\ngt crew start $RIG_NAME reviewer        # Start a crew member named \"reviewer\"\ngt crew at $RIG_NAME/reviewer           # Attach to the crew session\n```\nThen ask for review of:\n- CSS separation and reuse patterns\n- JS quality (if any)\n- Astro component structure\n- Build script quality\n\n### Learning: Document the test/review workflow\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Document Learnings\n\nCreate `learnings.md` with:\n\n### Sections Required\n1. **Project Initiation**: What `gt` commands, what directories are created, gotchas\n2. **Creating Plans**: How Mayor handles requirements → beads (or formulas for workflows)\n3. **Getting Plan into Beads**: The actual commands used, the bead IDs created\n4. **Executing via gt**: How `gt sling` works, convoy tracking, monitoring\n5. **Testing via gt**: How to verify agent work\n6. **Code Review via gt**: Crew-based review workflow\n7. **Working Directories Reference** (where `$RIG_NAME` is your rig, e.g., `website-eli`):\n   -

Let me also explore some more commands.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":787,"cache_read_input_tokens":44245,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":787,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXK2q2vy9xNmDryWj4Mnh","type":"assistant","uuid":"64b91f08-ca1f-41ac-ad39-05e6e89c900e","timestamp":"2026-01-20T17:34:29.220Z"}

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n(To be filled in during execution...)\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n(To be filled in during execution...)\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Welcome to Gas Town.md\n2. The Future of Coding Agents.md\n3. BAGS and the Creator Economy.md\n4. Gas Town Emergency User Manual.md\n5. Stevey's Birthday Blog.md\n\n### Docs to Shred (from `docs-fodder/gastown-docs/`)\n- 25 markdown files organized into concepts/, design/, examples/\n- Need a shredder script to sync these into the website\n\n## Social Links\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/xHpUGUzZp2\n- X: x.com/gastownhall\n\n## Landing Page Headline\n\"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n```\n\n**CLAUDE.md** - Claude agent instructions:\n```markdown\n# Claude Agent Instructions\n\nRead AGENTS.md for project structure and key information.\nRead plan.md for the implementation plan and success criteria.\n\n## Critical Constraint\nAll code must be written by agents via `gt` commands. Do not write code directly.\n\n## Your Role\nYou are working on a Gas Town rig. Use `gt` commands to:\n- Create beads via Mayor (`gt mayor attach`)\n- Dispatch work (`gt sling <bead> $RIG_NAME`)\n- Monitor progress (`gt ready --rig $RIG_NAME`)\n```\n\n**GEMINI.md** - Gemini agent instructions:\n```markdown\n# Gemini Agent Instructions\n\nRead AGENTS.md for project structure and key information.\nRead plan.md for the implementation plan and success criteria.\n\n## Critical Constraint\nAll code must be written by agents via `gt` commands. Do not write code directly.\n\n## Your Role\nYou are working on a Gas Town rig. Use `gt` commands to:\n- Create beads via Mayor (`gt mayor attach`)\n- Dispatch work (`gt sling <bead> $RIG_NAME`)\n- Monitor progress (`gt ready --rig $RIG_NAME`)\n```\n\n### Step 0.2: Add Rig to Gas Town\n\n**Existing HQ**: `~/gt/` is already initialized (daemon, deacon, mayor, dartantic rig exist)\n\n**Project**: Use the origin of the current working directory (supports multiple forks)\n\n### Steps (all commands run from cwd - no `cd` needed)\n\n```bash\n# Get the git remote URL and derive a rig name from the current project\nORIGIN=$(git remote get-url origin)\nRIG_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))  # e.g., \"website-eli\" from the folder name\n\n# 1. Add this project as a new rig (uses origin from current directory)\ngt rig add $RIG_NAME $ORIGIN --prefix $RIG_NAME\n\n# 2. Verify setup\ngt doctor --rig $RIG_NAME\ngt rig status $RIG_NAME\n```\n\n**Note**: Each agent works on their own copy of the repo (e.g., `gastown/website-eli`, `gastown/website-cc`). The rig name and prefix are derived from the project folder name to avoid conflicts.\n\n`gt rig add` clones the repo into `~/gt/$RIG_NAME/` and initializes:\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone","numLines":200,"startLine":1,"totalLines":551}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"c512ebe7-3f2f-4381-a7d4-88fe8d05e56c"}

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n(To be filled in during execution...)\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n### Discovery: Beads Can Be Created Directly\n\n**Key Learning**: You don't need Mayor to create beads. The `bd` (beads daemon) CLI can create issues directly.\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags discovered**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--file` - Create multiple issues from markdown file\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n**Two approaches to create beads**:\n1. **Interactive via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - chat with Mayor to create beads\n2. **Direct via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - script creation\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Mayor**: When you want AI to break down requirements into beads\n- **Direct bd**: When you know exactly what beads you need\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Resolves target (rig → auto-spawn polecat)\n2. Creates polecat from name pool\n3. Attaches bead to polecat's hook\n4. Auto-creates convoy for tracking\n5.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n### Discovery: Beads Can Be Created Directly\n\n**Key Learning**: You don't need Mayor to create beads. The `bd` (beads daemon) CLI can create issues directly.\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags discovered**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--file` - Create multiple issues from markdown file\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n**Two approaches to create beads**:\n1. **Interactive via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - chat with Mayor to create beads\n2. **Direct via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - script creation\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Mayor**: When you want AI to break down requirements into beads\n- **Direct bd**: When you know exactly what beads you need\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bead Management\n\n### Bead Hierarchy\n\n**Key Learning**: Child beads use hierarchical IDs based on parent.\n\n- Epic: `wcc-60j`\n- Child tasks: `wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`, etc.\n\nThis creates a natural tree structure that's visible in `bd list --pretty`.\n\n### Bead States\n\nBeads have operational states:\n- `open` - Not started\n- `in_progress` - Being worked on (has assignee or hook)\n- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies\n- `deferred` - Delayed until a date\n- `closed` - Completed\n\n### Checking Ready Work\n\n**Command**: `bd list --ready`\n\nShows beads that are:\n- Status = open\n- Not blocked by dependencies\n- Not deferred\n- Not hooked (already assigned)\n\n**Note**: `gt ready --rig <name>` shows ready work across the town but may filter differently.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n### Discovery: Beads Can Be Created Directly\n\n**Key Learning**: You don't need Mayor to create beads. The `bd` (beads daemon) CLI can create issues directly.\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags discovered**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--file` - Create multiple issues from markdown file\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n**Two approaches to create beads**:\n1. **Interactive via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - chat with Mayor to create beads\n2. **Direct via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - script creation\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Mayor**: When you want AI to break down requirements into beads\n- **Direct bd**: When you know exactly what beads you need\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bead Management\n\n### Bead Hierarchy\n\n**Key Learning**: Child beads use hierarchical IDs based on parent.\n\n- Epic: `wcc-60j`\n- Child tasks: `wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`, etc.\n\nThis creates a natural tree structure that's visible in `bd list --pretty`.\n\n### Bead States\n\nBeads have operational states:\n- `open` - Not started\n- `in_progress` - Being worked on (has assignee or hook)\n- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies\n- `deferred` - Delayed until a date\n- `closed` - Completed\n\n### Checking Ready Work\n\n**Command**: `bd list --ready`\n\nShows beads that are:\n- Status = open\n- Not blocked by dependencies\n- Not deferred\n- Not hooked (already assigned)\n\n**Note**: `gt ready --rig <name>` shows ready work across the town but may filter differently.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Work Dispatch (Sling)\n\n### The Sling Command\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead-id> <target>`\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` is THE unified command for dispatching work.\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Resolves target (rig → auto-spawn polecat)\n2. Creates polecat from name pool\n3. Attaches bead to polecat's hook\n4. Auto-creates convoy for tracking\n5. Sends start prompt to the polecat\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-60j.1 website_cc\n# → Allocated polecat: obsidian\n# → Created convoy hq-cv-lwwwc\n# → Polecat obsidian spawned\n```\n\n### Polecat Name Pool\n\n**Discovery**: Polecats get names from a name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx, etc.).\n\nNames are allocated automatically when slinging to a rig.\n\n### Work Branches\n\n**Key Learning**: Each polecat works on its own branch.\n\n- Branch format: `polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session-id>`\n- Example: `polecat/obsidian/wcc-60j.1@mkmvss0x`\n\nThe refinery merges these branches into main via the merge queue.\n\n### Adding Args to Work\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead> <target> --args \"natural language instructions\"`\n\nThe `--args` string is stored in the bead and shown to the polecat via `gt prime`.\nThis provides additional context beyond the bead description.\n\n### Batch Slinging\n\nYou can sling multiple beads to a rig in one command:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-1 wcc-2 wcc-3 website_cc\n```\nEach bead gets its own polecat.\n\n### Work Flow\n\n```\nHuman/Overseer\n     │\n     │ gt sling <bead> <rig>\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Polecat   │ ──→ Works on bead\n│  (obsidian) │     Creates branch\n└─────────────┘     Pushes changes\n     │\n     │ gt done (implicit when work completes)\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│ Merge Queue │ ──→ MR created\n│   (MQ:1)    │\n└─────────────┘\n     │\n     │ Refinery processes MQ\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Main      │ ──→ Merged code\n│  Branch     │\n└─────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n### Discovery: Beads Can Be Created Directly\n\n**Key Learning**: You don't need Mayor to create beads. The `bd` (beads daemon) CLI can create issues directly.\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags discovered**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--file` - Create multiple issues from markdown file\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n**Two approaches to create beads**:\n1. **Interactive via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - chat with Mayor to create beads\n2. **Direct via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - script creation\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Mayor**: When you want AI to break down requirements into beads\n- **Direct bd**: When you know exactly what beads you need\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bead Management\n\n### Bead Hierarchy\n\n**Key Learning**: Child beads use hierarchical IDs based on parent.\n\n- Epic: `wcc-60j`\n- Child tasks: `wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`, etc.\n\nThis creates a natural tree structure that's visible in `bd list --pretty`.\n\n### Bead States\n\nBeads have operational states:\n- `open` - Not started\n- `in_progress` - Being worked on (has assignee or hook)\n- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies\n- `deferred` - Delayed until a date\n- `closed` - Completed\n\n### Checking Ready Work\n\n**Command**: `bd list --ready`\n\nShows beads that are:\n- Status = open\n- Not blocked by dependencies\n- Not deferred\n- Not hooked (already assigned)\n\n**Note**: `gt ready --rig <name>` shows ready work across the town but may filter differently.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Work Dispatch (Sling)\n\n### The Sling Command\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead-id> <target>`\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` is THE unified command for dispatching work.\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Resolves target (rig → auto-spawn polecat)\n2. Creates polecat from name pool\n3. Attaches bead to polecat's hook\n4. Auto-creates convoy for tracking\n5. Sends start prompt to the polecat\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-60j.1 website_cc\n# → Allocated polecat: obsidian\n# → Created convoy hq-cv-lwwwc\n# → Polecat obsidian spawned\n```\n\n### Polecat Name Pool\n\n**Discovery**: Polecats get names from a name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx, etc.).\n\nNames are allocated automatically when slinging to a rig.\n\n### Work Branches\n\n**Key Learning**: Each polecat works on its own branch.\n\n- Branch format: `polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session-id>`\n- Example: `polecat/obsidian/wcc-60j.1@mkmvss0x`\n\nThe refinery merges these branches into main via the merge queue.\n\n### Adding Args to Work\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead> <target> --args \"natural language instructions\"`\n\nThe `--args` string is stored in the bead and shown to the polecat via `gt prime`.\nThis provides additional context beyond the bead description.\n\n### Batch Slinging\n\nYou can sling multiple beads to a rig in one command:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-1 wcc-2 wcc-3 website_cc\n```\nEach bead gets its own polecat.\n\n### Work Flow\n\n```\nHuman/Overseer\n     │\n     │ gt sling <bead> <rig>\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Polecat   │ ──→ Works on bead\n│  (obsidian) │     Creates branch\n└─────────────┘     Pushes changes\n     │\n     │ gt done (implicit when work completes)\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│ Merge Queue │ ──→ MR created\n│   (MQ:1)    │\n└─────────────┘\n     │\n     │ Refinery processes MQ\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Main      │ ──→ Merged code\n│  Branch     │\n└─────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Convoy Tracking\n\n### Auto-Convoy Creation\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` automatically creates a convoy for tracking.\n\nEach slinging operation creates a convoy like:\n- `hq-cv-lwwwc: Work: Astro project scaffold`\n- `hq-cv-5u67a: Work: Landing page`\n\n### Convoy Status\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy status <convoy-id>`\n\nShows:\n- Status (● in progress, ✓ completed)\n- Progress (0/1 completed)\n- Tracked issues with assignees\n\n### Convoy List\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy list`\n\nShows all active convoys with their statuses.\n\n### Merge Queue Issues\n\n**Issue Encountered**: Refinery failed to start with \"timeout waiting for runtime prompt\".\n\n**Workaround Attempted**:\n1. `gt nudge refinery \"Process the merge queue\"`\n2. `gt refinery start website_cc`\n3. `gt rig restart website_cc`\n\n**Learning**: When refinery has issues, the merge queue backs up. Work completes in polecat branches but doesn't get merged to main.\n\n**Root Cause Investigation Needed**: Why does the refinery timeout? Possible causes:\n- Claude Code session initialization issues\n- Resource constraints\n- Configuration problems\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n### Discovery: Beads Can Be Created Directly\n\n**Key Learning**: You don't need Mayor to create beads. The `bd` (beads daemon) CLI can create issues directly.\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags discovered**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--file` - Create multiple issues from markdown file\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n**Two approaches to create beads**:\n1. **Interactive via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - chat with Mayor to create beads\n2. **Direct via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - script creation\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Mayor**: When you want AI to break down requirements into beads\n- **Direct bd**: When you know exactly what beads you need\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bead Management\n\n### Bead Hierarchy\n\n**Key Learning**: Child beads use hierarchical IDs based on parent.\n\n- Epic: `wcc-60j`\n- Child tasks: `wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`, etc.\n\nThis creates a natural tree structure that's visible in `bd list --pretty`.\n\n### Bead States\n\nBeads have operational states:\n- `open` - Not started\n- `in_progress` - Being worked on (has assignee or hook)\n- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies\n- `deferred` - Delayed until a date\n- `closed` - Completed\n\n### Checking Ready Work\n\n**Command**: `bd list --ready`\n\nShows beads that are:\n- Status = open\n- Not blocked by dependencies\n- Not deferred\n- Not hooked (already assigned)\n\n**Note**: `gt ready --rig <name>` shows ready work across the town but may filter differently.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Work Dispatch (Sling)\n\n### The Sling Command\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead-id> <target>`\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` is THE unified command for dispatching work.\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Resolves target (rig → auto-spawn polecat)\n2. Creates polecat from name pool\n3. Attaches bead to polecat's hook\n4. Auto-creates convoy for tracking\n5. Sends start prompt to the polecat\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-60j.1 website_cc\n# → Allocated polecat: obsidian\n# → Created convoy hq-cv-lwwwc\n# → Polecat obsidian spawned\n```\n\n### Polecat Name Pool\n\n**Discovery**: Polecats get names from a name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx, etc.).\n\nNames are allocated automatically when slinging to a rig.\n\n### Work Branches\n\n**Key Learning**: Each polecat works on its own branch.\n\n- Branch format: `polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session-id>`\n- Example: `polecat/obsidian/wcc-60j.1@mkmvss0x`\n\nThe refinery merges these branches into main via the merge queue.\n\n### Adding Args to Work\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead> <target> --args \"natural language instructions\"`\n\nThe `--args` string is stored in the bead and shown to the polecat via `gt prime`.\nThis provides additional context beyond the bead description.\n\n### Batch Slinging\n\nYou can sling multiple beads to a rig in one command:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-1 wcc-2 wcc-3 website_cc\n```\nEach bead gets its own polecat.\n\n### Work Flow\n\n```\nHuman/Overseer\n     │\n     │ gt sling <bead> <rig>\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Polecat   │ ──→ Works on bead\n│  (obsidian) │     Creates branch\n└─────────────┘     Pushes changes\n     │\n     │ gt done (implicit when work completes)\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│ Merge Queue │ ──→ MR created\n│   (MQ:1)    │\n└─────────────┘\n     │\n     │ Refinery processes MQ\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Main      │ ──→ Merged code\n│  Branch     │\n└─────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Convoy Tracking\n\n### Auto-Convoy Creation\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` automatically creates a convoy for tracking.\n\nEach slinging operation creates a convoy like:\n- `hq-cv-lwwwc: Work: Astro project scaffold`\n- `hq-cv-5u67a: Work: Landing page`\n\n### Convoy Status\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy status <convoy-id>`\n\nShows:\n- Status (● in progress, ✓ completed)\n- Progress (0/1 completed)\n- Tracked issues with assignees\n\n### Convoy List\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy list`\n\nShows all active convoys with their statuses.\n\n### Merge Queue Issues\n\n**Issue Encountered**: Refinery failed to start with \"timeout waiting for runtime prompt\".\n\n**Workaround Attempted**:\n1. `gt nudge refinery \"Process the merge queue\"`\n2. `gt refinery start website_cc`\n3. `gt rig restart website_cc`\n\n**Learning**: When refinery has issues, the merge queue backs up. Work completes in polecat branches but doesn't get merged to main.\n\n**Root Cause Investigation Needed**: Why does the refinery timeout? Possible causes:\n- Claude Code session initialization issues\n- Resource constraints\n- Configuration problems\n\n---\n\n## 7. Testing & Review\n\n### Build Verification\n\n**Command**: `cd src && npm run build`\n\n**Result**: Build succeeded with:\n- Docs shredder processed 25 markdown files\n- llms.txt generated\n- 3 static pages built (index, docs, privacy)\n- Output in deploy/ folder\n\n### Pages Generated\n\n1. `/index.html` - Landing page with:\n   - Headline: \"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n   - 5 blog post links\n   - Discord CTA button\n   - X link\n   - Docs navigation\n\n2. `/docs/index.html` - Docs landing page\n\n3. `/privacy/index.html` - Privacy policy\n\n4. `/robots.txt` - SEO robots file\n\n5. `/llms.txt` - LLM context file\n\n---\n\n## 8.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n### Discovery: Beads Can Be Created Directly\n\n**Key Learning**: You don't need Mayor to create beads. The `bd` (beads daemon) CLI can create issues directly.\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags discovered**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--file` - Create multiple issues from markdown file\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n**Two approaches to create beads**:\n1. **Interactive via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - chat with Mayor to create beads\n2. **Direct via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - script creation\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Mayor**: When you want AI to break down requirements into beads\n- **Direct bd**: When you know exactly what beads you need\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bead Management\n\n### Bead Hierarchy\n\n**Key Learning**: Child beads use hierarchical IDs based on parent.\n\n- Epic: `wcc-60j`\n- Child tasks: `wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`, etc.\n\nThis creates a natural tree structure that's visible in `bd list --pretty`.\n\n### Bead States\n\nBeads have operational states:\n- `open` - Not started\n- `in_progress` - Being worked on (has assignee or hook)\n- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies\n- `deferred` - Delayed until a date\n- `closed` - Completed\n\n### Checking Ready Work\n\n**Command**: `bd list --ready`\n\nShows beads that are:\n- Status = open\n- Not blocked by dependencies\n- Not deferred\n- Not hooked (already assigned)\n\n**Note**: `gt ready --rig <name>` shows ready work across the town but may filter differently.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Work Dispatch (Sling)\n\n### The Sling Command\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead-id> <target>`\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` is THE unified command for dispatching work.\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Resolves target (rig → auto-spawn polecat)\n2. Creates polecat from name pool\n3. Attaches bead to polecat's hook\n4. Auto-creates convoy for tracking\n5. Sends start prompt to the polecat\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-60j.1 website_cc\n# → Allocated polecat: obsidian\n# → Created convoy hq-cv-lwwwc\n# → Polecat obsidian spawned\n```\n\n### Polecat Name Pool\n\n**Discovery**: Polecats get names from a name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx, etc.).\n\nNames are allocated automatically when slinging to a rig.\n\n### Work Branches\n\n**Key Learning**: Each polecat works on its own branch.\n\n- Branch format: `polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session-id>`\n- Example: `polecat/obsidian/wcc-60j.1@mkmvss0x`\n\nThe refinery merges these branches into main via the merge queue.\n\n### Adding Args to Work\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead> <target> --args \"natural language instructions\"`\n\nThe `--args` string is stored in the bead and shown to the polecat via `gt prime`.\nThis provides additional context beyond the bead description.\n\n### Batch Slinging\n\nYou can sling multiple beads to a rig in one command:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-1 wcc-2 wcc-3 website_cc\n```\nEach bead gets its own polecat.\n\n### Work Flow\n\n```\nHuman/Overseer\n     │\n     │ gt sling <bead> <rig>\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Polecat   │ ──→ Works on bead\n│  (obsidian) │     Creates branch\n└─────────────┘     Pushes changes\n     │\n     │ gt done (implicit when work completes)\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│ Merge Queue │ ──→ MR created\n│   (MQ:1)    │\n└─────────────┘\n     │\n     │ Refinery processes MQ\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Main      │ ──→ Merged code\n│  Branch     │\n└─────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Convoy Tracking\n\n### Auto-Convoy Creation\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` automatically creates a convoy for tracking.\n\nEach slinging operation creates a convoy like:\n- `hq-cv-lwwwc: Work: Astro project scaffold`\n- `hq-cv-5u67a: Work: Landing page`\n\n### Convoy Status\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy status <convoy-id>`\n\nShows:\n- Status (● in progress, ✓ completed)\n- Progress (0/1 completed)\n- Tracked issues with assignees\n\n### Convoy List\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy list`\n\nShows all active convoys with their statuses.\n\n### Merge Queue Issues\n\n**Issue Encountered**: Refinery failed to start with \"timeout waiting for runtime prompt\".\n\n**Workaround Attempted**:\n1. `gt nudge refinery \"Process the merge queue\"`\n2. `gt refinery start website_cc`\n3. `gt rig restart website_cc`\n\n**Learning**: When refinery has issues, the merge queue backs up. Work completes in polecat branches but doesn't get merged to main.\n\n**Root Cause Investigation Needed**: Why does the refinery timeout? Possible causes:\n- Claude Code session initialization issues\n- Resource constraints\n- Configuration problems\n\n---\n\n## 7. Testing & Review\n\n### Build Verification\n\n**Command**: `cd src && npm run build`\n\n**Result**: Build succeeded with:\n- Docs shredder processed 25 markdown files\n- llms.txt generated\n- 3 static pages built (index, docs, privacy)\n- Output in deploy/ folder\n\n### Pages Generated\n\n1. `/index.html` - Landing page with:\n   - Headline: \"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n### Discovery: Beads Can Be Created Directly\n\n**Key Learning**: You don't need Mayor to create beads. The `bd` (beads daemon) CLI can create issues directly.\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags discovered**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--file` - Create multiple issues from markdown file\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n**Two approaches to create beads**:\n1. **Interactive via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - chat with Mayor to create beads\n2. **Direct via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - script creation\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Mayor**: When you want AI to break down requirements into beads\n- **Direct bd**: When you know exactly what beads you need\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bead Management\n\n### Bead Hierarchy\n\n**Key Learning**: Child beads use hierarchical IDs based on parent.\n\n- Epic: `wcc-60j`\n- Child tasks: `wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`, etc.\n\nThis creates a natural tree structure that's visible in `bd list --pretty`.\n\n### Bead States\n\nBeads have operational states:\n- `open` - Not started\n- `in_progress` - Being worked on (has assignee or hook)\n- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies\n- `deferred` - Delayed until a date\n- `closed` - Completed\n\n### Checking Ready Work\n\n**Command**: `bd list --ready`\n\nShows beads that are:\n- Status = open\n- Not blocked by dependencies\n- Not deferred\n- Not hooked (already assigned)\n\n**Note**: `gt ready --rig <name>` shows ready work across the town but may filter differently.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Work Dispatch (Sling)\n\n### The Sling Command\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead-id> <target>`\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` is THE unified command for dispatching work.\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Resolves target (rig → auto-spawn polecat)\n2. Creates polecat from name pool\n3. Attaches bead to polecat's hook\n4. Auto-creates convoy for tracking\n5. Sends start prompt to the polecat\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-60j.1 website_cc\n# → Allocated polecat: obsidian\n# → Created convoy hq-cv-lwwwc\n# → Polecat obsidian spawned\n```\n\n### Polecat Name Pool\n\n**Discovery**: Polecats get names from a name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx, etc.).\n\nNames are allocated automatically when slinging to a rig.\n\n### Work Branches\n\n**Key Learning**: Each polecat works on its own branch.\n\n- Branch format: `polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session-id>`\n- Example: `polecat/obsidian/wcc-60j.1@mkmvss0x`\n\nThe refinery merges these branches into main via the merge queue.\n\n### Adding Args to Work\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead> <target> --args \"natural language instructions\"`\n\nThe `--args` string is stored in the bead and shown to the polecat via `gt prime`.\nThis provides additional context beyond the bead description.\n\n### Batch Slinging\n\nYou can sling multiple beads to a rig in one command:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-1 wcc-2 wcc-3 website_cc\n```\nEach bead gets its own polecat.\n\n### Work Flow\n\n```\nHuman/Overseer\n     │\n     │ gt sling <bead> <rig>\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Polecat   │ ──→ Works on bead\n│  (obsidian) │     Creates branch\n└─────────────┘     Pushes changes\n     │\n     │ gt done (implicit when work completes)\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│ Merge Queue │ ──→ MR created\n│   (MQ:1)    │\n└─────────────┘\n     │\n     │ Refinery processes MQ\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Main      │ ──→ Merged code\n│  Branch     │\n└─────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Convoy Tracking\n\n### Auto-Convoy Creation\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` automatically creates a convoy for tracking.\n\nEach slinging operation creates a convoy like:\n- `hq-cv-lwwwc: Work: Astro project scaffold`\n- `hq-cv-5u67a: Work: Landing page`\n\n### Convoy Status\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy status <convoy-id>`\n\nShows:\n- Status (● in progress, ✓ completed)\n- Progress (0/1 completed)\n- Tracked issues with assignees\n\n### Convoy List\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy list`\n\nShows all active convoys with their statuses.\n\n### Merge Queue Issues\n\n**Issue Encountered**: Refinery failed to start with \"timeout waiting for runtime prompt\".\n\n**Workaround Attempted**:\n1. `gt nudge refinery \"Process the merge queue\"`\n2. `gt refinery start website_cc`\n3. `gt rig restart website_cc`\n\n**Learning**: When refinery has issues, the merge queue backs up. Work completes in polecat branches but doesn't get merged to main.\n\n**Root Cause Investigation Needed**: Why does the refinery timeout? Possible causes:\n- Claude Code session initialization issues\n- Resource constraints\n- Configuration problems\n\n---\n\n## 7. Testing & Review\n\n### Build Verification\n\n**Command**: `cd src && npm run build`\n\n**Result**: Build succeeded with:\n- Docs shredder processed 25 markdown files\n- llms.txt generated\n- 3 static pages built (index, docs, privacy)\n- Output in deploy/ folder\n\n### Pages Generated\n\n1. `/index.html` - Landing page with:\n   - Headline: \"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n   - 5 blog post links\n   - Discord CTA button\n   - X link\n   - Docs navigation\n\n2. `/docs/index.html` - Docs landing page\n\n3. `/privacy/index.html` - Privacy policy\n\n4. `/robots.txt` - SEO robots file\n\n5. `/llms.txt` - LLM context file\n\n---\n\n## 8. Commands Discovered\n\n### Not in Original Plan but Useful\n\n| Command | Purpose | When to Use |\n|---------|---------|-------------|\n| `gt info` | Show Gas Town version | Check for updates |\n| `gt feed` | Real-time activity feed | Monitor all activity |\n| `gt trail` | Recent agent activity | Debug agent behavior |\n| `gt audit` | Query work history | Understand past work |\n| `gt prime` | Output role context | See what context agents get |\n| `gt seance` | Talk to predecessor | Learn from past sessions |\n| `gt peek` | View polecat output | Debug worker issues |\n| `gt mol` | Molecule workflows | Reusable patterns |\n| `gt dashboard` | Web dashboard | Visual convoy tracking |\n| `gt nudge` | Send message to agent | Wake up or redirect agents |\n| `gt doctor --fix` | Auto-fix workspace issues | After setup or when things break |\n| `bd create` | Create beads directly | When you know what beads you need |\n| `bd list --ready` | Show ready beads | Find work to dispatch |\n| `bd show <id>` | Show bead details | Inspect dependencies |\n\n### bd (Beads) Commands\n\nThe `bd` CLI is separate from `gt` and works directly with the beads database:\n\n```bash\nbd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\" --parent <epic-id>\nbd list --ready\nbd show <bead-id>\nbd close <bead-id>\nbd epic <epic-id>  # Manage epic hierarchy\n```\n\n### Git Workflow in Refinery\n\nWhen manually resolving merges:\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/refinery/rig\ngit fetch origin\ngit merge <branch> -m \"Merge: <description>\"\n# Resolve conflicts if any\ngit add . && git commit -m \"...\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. What Worked\n\n### 1. Rig Setup with `gt rig add`\n- Quick and comprehensive setup (5 seconds)\n- Creates all necessary directories and agent beads automatically\n- Proper git structure with shared bare repo\n\n### 2. Direct Bead Creation with `bd create`\n- Fast way to create beads when you know the structure\n- Hierarchical IDs (`wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`) make relationships clear\n- `--parent` flag creates proper epic/child structure\n\n### 3. Parallel Work Dispatch with `gt sling`\n- Spawning multiple polecats for parallel work was effective\n- Auto-convoy creation provides visibility\n- Name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx) is fun and memorable\n\n### 4. Polecat Autonomy\n- Polecats read context files (AGENTS.md, plan.md) and work independently\n- They create branches, commit code, and push to remote\n- No hand-holding needed once work is slung\n\n### 5. Build Scripts by Agents\n- Polecats created working build scripts (docs shredder, llms.txt generator)\n- Proper Astro configuration for static site generation\n- All 25 docs were processed correctly\n\n### 6. `gt peek` for Monitoring\n- Real-time visibility into what polecats are doing\n- Shows thinking, commands, and output\n- Essential for debugging\n\n---\n\n## 10.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n### Discovery: Beads Can Be Created Directly\n\n**Key Learning**: You don't need Mayor to create beads. The `bd` (beads daemon) CLI can create issues directly.\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags discovered**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--file` - Create multiple issues from markdown file\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n**Two approaches to create beads**:\n1. **Interactive via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - chat with Mayor to create beads\n2. **Direct via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - script creation\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Mayor**: When you want AI to break down requirements into beads\n- **Direct bd**: When you know exactly what beads you need\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bead Management\n\n### Bead Hierarchy\n\n**Key Learning**: Child beads use hierarchical IDs based on parent.\n\n- Epic: `wcc-60j`\n- Child tasks: `wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`, etc.\n\nThis creates a natural tree structure that's visible in `bd list --pretty`.\n\n### Bead States\n\nBeads have operational states:\n- `open` - Not started\n- `in_progress` - Being worked on (has assignee or hook)\n- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies\n- `deferred` - Delayed until a date\n- `closed` - Completed\n\n### Checking Ready Work\n\n**Command**: `bd list --ready`\n\nShows beads that are:\n- Status = open\n- Not blocked by dependencies\n- Not deferred\n- Not hooked (already assigned)\n\n**Note**: `gt ready --rig <name>` shows ready work across the town but may filter differently.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Work Dispatch (Sling)\n\n### The Sling Command\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead-id> <target>`\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` is THE unified command for dispatching work.\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Resolves target (rig → auto-spawn polecat)\n2. Creates polecat from name pool\n3. Attaches bead to polecat's hook\n4. Auto-creates convoy for tracking\n5. Sends start prompt to the polecat\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-60j.1 website_cc\n# → Allocated polecat: obsidian\n# → Created convoy hq-cv-lwwwc\n# → Polecat obsidian spawned\n```\n\n### Polecat Name Pool\n\n**Discovery**: Polecats get names from a name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx, etc.).\n\nNames are allocated automatically when slinging to a rig.\n\n### Work Branches\n\n**Key Learning**: Each polecat works on its own branch.\n\n- Branch format: `polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session-id>`\n- Example: `polecat/obsidian/wcc-60j.1@mkmvss0x`\n\nThe refinery merges these branches into main via the merge queue.\n\n### Adding Args to Work\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead> <target> --args \"natural language instructions\"`\n\nThe `--args` string is stored in the bead and shown to the polecat via `gt prime`.\nThis provides additional context beyond the bead description.\n\n### Batch Slinging\n\nYou can sling multiple beads to a rig in one command:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-1 wcc-2 wcc-3 website_cc\n```\nEach bead gets its own polecat.\n\n### Work Flow\n\n```\nHuman/Overseer\n     │\n     │ gt sling <bead> <rig>\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Polecat   │ ──→ Works on bead\n│  (obsidian) │     Creates branch\n└─────────────┘     Pushes changes\n     │\n     │ gt done (implicit when work completes)\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│ Merge Queue │ ──→ MR created\n│   (MQ:1)    │\n└─────────────┘\n     │\n     │ Refinery processes MQ\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Main      │ ──→ Merged code\n│  Branch     │\n└─────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Convoy Tracking\n\n### Auto-Convoy Creation\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` automatically creates a convoy for tracking.\n\nEach slinging operation creates a convoy like:\n- `hq-cv-lwwwc: Work: Astro project scaffold`\n- `hq-cv-5u67a: Work: Landing page`\n\n### Convoy Status\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy status <convoy-id>`\n\nShows:\n- Status (● in progress, ✓ completed)\n- Progress (0/1 completed)\n- Tracked issues with assignees\n\n### Convoy List\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy list`\n\nShows all active convoys with their statuses.\n\n### Merge Queue Issues\n\n**Issue Encountered**: Refinery failed to start with \"timeout waiting for runtime prompt\".\n\n**Workaround Attempted**:\n1. `gt nudge refinery \"Process the merge queue\"`\n2. `gt refinery start website_cc`\n3. `gt rig restart website_cc`\n\n**Learning**: When refinery has issues, the merge queue backs up. Work completes in polecat branches but doesn't get merged to main.\n\n**Root Cause Investigation Needed**: Why does the refinery timeout? Possible causes:\n- Claude Code session initialization issues\n- Resource constraints\n- Configuration problems\n\n---\n\n## 7. Testing & Review\n\n### Build Verification\n\n**Command**: `cd src && npm run build`\n\n**Result**: Build succeeded with:\n- Docs shredder processed 25 markdown files\n- llms.txt generated\n- 3 static pages built (index, docs, privacy)\n- Output in deploy/ folder\n\n### Pages Generated\n\n1. `/index.html` - Landing page with:\n   - Headline: \"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n   - 5 blog post links\n   - Discord CTA button\n   - X link\n   - Docs navigation\n\n2. `/docs/index.html` - Docs landing page\n\n3. `/privacy/index.html` - Privacy policy\n\n4. `/robots.txt` - SEO robots file\n\n5. `/llms.txt` - LLM context file\n\n---\n\n## 8. Commands Discovered\n\n### Not in Original Plan but Useful\n\n| Command | Purpose | When to Use |\n|---------|---------|-------------|\n| `gt info` | Show Gas Town version | Check for updates |\n| `gt feed` | Real-time activity feed | Monitor all activity |\n| `gt trail` | Recent agent activity | Debug agent behavior |\n| `gt audit` | Query work history | Understand past work |\n| `gt prime` | Output role context | See what context agents get |\n| `gt seance` | Talk to predecessor | Learn from past sessions |\n| `gt peek` | View polecat output | Debug worker issues |\n| `gt mol` | Molecule workflows | Reusable patterns |\n| `gt dashboard` | Web dashboard | Visual convoy tracking |\n| `gt nudge` | Send message to agent | Wake up or redirect agents |\n| `gt doctor --fix` | Auto-fix workspace issues | After setup or when things break |\n| `bd create` | Create beads directly | When you know what beads you need |\n| `bd list --ready` | Show ready beads | Find work to dispatch |\n| `bd show <id>` | Show bead details | Inspect dependencies |\n\n### bd (Beads) Commands\n\nThe `bd` CLI is separate from `gt` and works directly with the beads database:\n\n```bash\nbd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\" --parent <epic-id>\nbd list --ready\nbd show <bead-id>\nbd close <bead-id>\nbd epic <epic-id>  # Manage epic hierarchy\n```\n\n### Git Workflow in Refinery\n\nWhen manually resolving merges:\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/refinery/rig\ngit fetch origin\ngit merge <branch> -m \"Merge: <description>\"\n# Resolve conflicts if any\ngit add . && git commit -m \"...\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. What Worked\n\n### 1. Rig Setup with `gt rig add`\n- Quick and comprehensive setup (5 seconds)\n- Creates all necessary directories and agent beads automatically\n- Proper git structure with shared bare repo\n\n### 2. Direct Bead Creation with `bd create`\n- Fast way to create beads when you know the structure\n- Hierarchical IDs (`wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`) make relationships clear\n- `--parent` flag creates proper epic/child structure\n\n### 3. Parallel Work Dispatch with `gt sling`\n- Spawning multiple polecats for parallel work was effective\n- Auto-convoy creation provides visibility\n- Name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx) is fun and memorable\n\n### 4. Polecat Autonomy\n- Polecats read context files (AGENTS.md, plan.md) and work independently\n- They create branches, commit code, and push to remote\n- No hand-holding needed once work is slung\n\n### 5. Build Scripts by Agents\n- Polecats created working build scripts (docs shredder, llms.txt generator)\n- Proper Astro configuration for static site generation\n- All 25 docs were processed correctly\n\n### 6. `gt peek` for Monitoring\n- Real-time visibility into what polecats are doing\n- Shows thinking, commands, and output\n- Essential for debugging\n\n---\n\n## 10. What Didn't Work\n\n### 1. Refinery Auto-Processing\n- **Issue**: Refinery kept crashing or sitting idle\n- **Symptom**: `gt refinery start website_cc` → \"timeout waiting for runtime prompt\"\n- **Impact**: Merge queue backed up with 3+ ready MRs\n- **Root Cause**: Unknown - possibly Claude session initialization issues\n\n### 2. Rig Names with Hyphens\n- **Issue**: `gt rig add website-cc` failed\n- **Error**: \"hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing\"\n- **Solution**: Use underscores instead (`website_cc`)\n\n### 3. Dependency Blocking Not Working\n- **Expected**: wcc-60j.2 should wait for wcc-60j.1 to complete\n- **Actual**: All beads showed as \"ready\" despite dependencies\n- **Impact**: Parallel work on dependent tasks caused merge conflicts\n- **Possible Cause**: Dependencies may only block at bead level, not branch level\n\n### 4. Merge Conflicts from Parallel Work\n- **Issue**: Polecats modified same files (astro.config.mjs, index.astro)\n- **Symptom**: Merge conflicts when combining branches\n- **Learning**: Need to sequence dependent work OR design for parallel mergeability\n\n### 5. `gt ready --rig` Showing No Work\n- **Issue**: `gt ready --rig website_cc` returned \"No ready work across town\"\n- **But**: `bd list --ready` showed all beads as ready\n- **Possible Cause**: Different filtering between `gt ready` and `bd list --ready`\n\n---\n\n## 11.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n### Checking Town Status\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt status`\n**Result**:\n```\nTown: gt\n/Users/csells/gt\n\nOverseer: Chris Sells <csells@sellsbrothers.com>\n\nmayor        ● (running)\ndeacon       ○ (stopped)\n\n--- dartantic/ ---\nwitness      ● (running)\nrefinery     ● (running)\nCrew: bob    ○ (stopped)\n```\n\n**Learning**: Status shows all agents across all rigs. Symbols indicate running (●) vs stopped (○).\n\n### Identity Check\n\n**Command**: `gt whoami`\n**Result**: `Identity: overseer, Source: no GT_ROLE set (human at terminal)`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town uses role-based identity. When not in an agent session, you're the \"overseer\" (human).\n\n### Listing Rigs\n\n**Command**: `cd ~/gt && gt rig list`\n**Result**: Shows \"dartantic\" with 2 crew members, 0 polecats, agents [refinery witness mayor]\n\n**Learning**: Each rig has:\n- Polecats (ephemeral workers)\n- Crew (persistent human workspaces)\n- Core agents (refinery, witness, mayor)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n**Command**: `gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>`\n\nAccording to `gt rig add --help`, this creates:\n- `config.json` - Rig configuration\n- `.beads/` - Rig-level issue tracking (initialized)\n- `plugins/` - Rig-level plugin directory\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `crew/` - Empty crew directory\n- `witness/` - Witness agent directory\n- `polecats/` - Worker directory (empty)\n\n**Why This Structure**:\n- `refinery/rig/` is the \"source of truth\" - the merge queue target\n- `mayor/rig/` is where Mayor plans and creates beads\n- `polecats/` is for ephemeral workers that do actual coding\n- `crew/` is for human developers doing reviews or manual work\n\n### Actual Setup Steps\n\n**Step 1: Attempted `gt rig add website-cc ...`**\n- **FAILED**: Rig names cannot contain hyphens\n- **Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n- **WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n**Step 2: Used underscores instead**\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result**: Success in 5.0s\n\n**What was created**:\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n**KEY LEARNING**: Use underscores in rig names, not hyphens. The prefix (wcc) becomes the bead ID prefix.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mayor Workflow\n\n### Discovery: Beads Can Be Created Directly\n\n**Key Learning**: You don't need Mayor to create beads. The `bd` (beads daemon) CLI can create issues directly.\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags discovered**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--file` - Create multiple issues from markdown file\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n**Two approaches to create beads**:\n1. **Interactive via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - chat with Mayor to create beads\n2. **Direct via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - script creation\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Mayor**: When you want AI to break down requirements into beads\n- **Direct bd**: When you know exactly what beads you need\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bead Management\n\n### Bead Hierarchy\n\n**Key Learning**: Child beads use hierarchical IDs based on parent.\n\n- Epic: `wcc-60j`\n- Child tasks: `wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`, etc.\n\nThis creates a natural tree structure that's visible in `bd list --pretty`.\n\n### Bead States\n\nBeads have operational states:\n- `open` - Not started\n- `in_progress` - Being worked on (has assignee or hook)\n- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies\n- `deferred` - Delayed until a date\n- `closed` - Completed\n\n### Checking Ready Work\n\n**Command**: `bd list --ready`\n\nShows beads that are:\n- Status = open\n- Not blocked by dependencies\n- Not deferred\n- Not hooked (already assigned)\n\n**Note**: `gt ready --rig <name>` shows ready work across the town but may filter differently.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Work Dispatch (Sling)\n\n### The Sling Command\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead-id> <target>`\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` is THE unified command for dispatching work.\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Resolves target (rig → auto-spawn polecat)\n2. Creates polecat from name pool\n3. Attaches bead to polecat's hook\n4. Auto-creates convoy for tracking\n5. Sends start prompt to the polecat\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-60j.1 website_cc\n# → Allocated polecat: obsidian\n# → Created convoy hq-cv-lwwwc\n# → Polecat obsidian spawned\n```\n\n### Polecat Name Pool\n\n**Discovery**: Polecats get names from a name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx, etc.).\n\nNames are allocated automatically when slinging to a rig.\n\n### Work Branches\n\n**Key Learning**: Each polecat works on its own branch.\n\n- Branch format: `polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session-id>`\n- Example: `polecat/obsidian/wcc-60j.1@mkmvss0x`\n\nThe refinery merges these branches into main via the merge queue.\n\n### Adding Args to Work\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead> <target> --args \"natural language instructions\"`\n\nThe `--args` string is stored in the bead and shown to the polecat via `gt prime`.\nThis provides additional context beyond the bead description.\n\n### Batch Slinging\n\nYou can sling multiple beads to a rig in one command:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-1 wcc-2 wcc-3 website_cc\n```\nEach bead gets its own polecat.\n\n### Work Flow\n\n```\nHuman/Overseer\n     │\n     │ gt sling <bead> <rig>\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Polecat   │ ──→ Works on bead\n│  (obsidian) │     Creates branch\n└─────────────┘     Pushes changes\n     │\n     │ gt done (implicit when work completes)\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│ Merge Queue │ ──→ MR created\n│   (MQ:1)    │\n└─────────────┘\n     │\n     │ Refinery processes MQ\n     ▼\n┌─────────────┐\n│   Main      │ ──→ Merged code\n│  Branch     │\n└─────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Convoy Tracking\n\n### Auto-Convoy Creation\n\n**Key Learning**: `gt sling` automatically creates a convoy for tracking.\n\nEach slinging operation creates a convoy like:\n- `hq-cv-lwwwc: Work: Astro project scaffold`\n- `hq-cv-5u67a: Work: Landing page`\n\n### Convoy Status\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy status <convoy-id>`\n\nShows:\n- Status (● in progress, ✓ completed)\n- Progress (0/1 completed)\n- Tracked issues with assignees\n\n### Convoy List\n\n**Command**: `gt convoy list`\n\nShows all active convoys with their statuses.\n\n### Merge Queue Issues\n\n**Issue Encountered**: Refinery failed to start with \"timeout waiting for runtime prompt\".\n\n**Workaround Attempted**:\n1. `gt nudge refinery \"Process the merge queue\"`\n2. `gt refinery start website_cc`\n3. `gt rig restart website_cc`\n\n**Learning**: When refinery has issues, the merge queue backs up. Work completes in polecat branches but doesn't get merged to main.\n\n**Root Cause Investigation Needed**: Why does the refinery timeout? Possible causes:\n- Claude Code session initialization issues\n- Resource constraints\n- Configuration problems\n\n---\n\n## 7. Testing & Review\n\n### Build Verification\n\n**Command**: `cd src && npm run build`\n\n**Result**: Build succeeded with:\n- Docs shredder processed 25 markdown files\n- llms.txt generated\n- 3 static pages built (index, docs, privacy)\n- Output in deploy/ folder\n\n### Pages Generated\n\n1. `/index.html` - Landing page with:\n   - Headline: \"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n   - 5 blog post links\n   - Discord CTA button\n   - X link\n   - Docs navigation\n\n2. `/docs/index.html` - Docs landing page\n\n3. `/privacy/index.html` - Privacy policy\n\n4. `/robots.txt` - SEO robots file\n\n5. `/llms.txt` - LLM context file\n\n---\n\n## 8. Commands Discovered\n\n### Not in Original Plan but Useful\n\n| Command | Purpose | When to Use |\n|---------|---------|-------------|\n| `gt info` | Show Gas Town version | Check for updates |\n| `gt feed` | Real-time activity feed | Monitor all activity |\n| `gt trail` | Recent agent activity | Debug agent behavior |\n| `gt audit` | Query work history | Understand past work |\n| `gt prime` | Output role context | See what context agents get |\n| `gt seance` | Talk to predecessor | Learn from past sessions |\n| `gt peek` | View polecat output | Debug worker issues |\n| `gt mol` | Molecule workflows | Reusable patterns |\n| `gt dashboard` | Web dashboard | Visual convoy tracking |\n| `gt nudge` | Send message to agent | Wake up or redirect agents |\n| `gt doctor --fix` | Auto-fix workspace issues | After setup or when things break |\n| `bd create` | Create beads directly | When you know what beads you need |\n| `bd list --ready` | Show ready beads | Find work to dispatch |\n| `bd show <id>` | Show bead details | Inspect dependencies |\n\n### bd (Beads) Commands\n\nThe `bd` CLI is separate from `gt` and works directly with the beads database:\n\n```bash\nbd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\" --parent <epic-id>\nbd list --ready\nbd show <bead-id>\nbd close <bead-id>\nbd epic <epic-id>  # Manage epic hierarchy\n```\n\n### Git Workflow in Refinery\n\nWhen manually resolving merges:\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/refinery/rig\ngit fetch origin\ngit merge <branch> -m \"Merge: <description>\"\n# Resolve conflicts if any\ngit add . && git commit -m \"...\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. What Worked\n\n### 1. Rig Setup with `gt rig add`\n- Quick and comprehensive setup (5 seconds)\n- Creates all necessary directories and agent beads automatically\n- Proper git structure with shared bare repo\n\n### 2. Direct Bead Creation with `bd create`\n- Fast way to create beads when you know the structure\n- Hierarchical IDs (`wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`) make relationships clear\n- `--parent` flag creates proper epic/child structure\n\n### 3. Parallel Work Dispatch with `gt sling`\n- Spawning multiple polecats for parallel work was effective\n- Auto-convoy creation provides visibility\n- Name pool (obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx) is fun and memorable\n\n### 4. Polecat Autonomy\n- Polecats read context files (AGENTS.md, plan.md) and work independently\n- They create branches, commit code, and push to remote\n- No hand-holding needed once work is slung\n\n### 5. Build Scripts by Agents\n- Polecats created working build scripts (docs shredder, llms.txt generator)\n- Proper Astro configuration for static site generation\n- All 25 docs were processed correctly\n\n### 6. `gt peek` for Monitoring\n- Real-time visibility into what polecats are doing\n- Shows thinking, commands, and output\n- Essential for debugging\n\n---\n\n## 10. What Didn't Work\n\n### 1. Refinery Auto-Processing\n- **Issue**: Refinery kept crashing or sitting idle\n- **Symptom**: `gt refinery start website_cc` → \"timeout waiting for runtime prompt\"\n- **Impact**: Merge queue backed up with 3+ ready MRs\n- **Root Cause**: Unknown - possibly Claude session initialization issues\n\n### 2. Rig Names with Hyphens\n- **Issue**: `gt rig add website-cc` failed\n- **Error**: \"hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing\"\n- **Solution**: Use underscores instead (`website_cc`)\n\n### 3. Dependency Blocking Not Working\n- **Expected**: wcc-60j.2 should wait for wcc-60j.1 to complete\n- **Actual**: All beads showed as \"ready\" despite dependencies\n- **Impact**: Parallel work on dependent tasks caused merge conflicts\n- **Possible Cause**: Dependencies may only block at bead level, not branch level\n\n### 4. Merge Conflicts from Parallel Work\n- **Issue**: Polecats modified same files (astro.config.mjs, index.astro)\n- **Symptom**: Merge conflicts when combining branches\n- **Learning**: Need to sequence dependent work OR design for parallel mergeability\n\n### 5. `gt ready --rig` Showing No Work\n- **Issue**: `gt ready --rig website_cc` returned \"No ready work across town\"\n- **But**: `bd list --ready` showed all beads as ready\n- **Possible Cause**: Different filtering between `gt ready` and `bd list --ready`\n\n---\n\n## 11. Workarounds\n\n### 1. Manual Merge When Refinery Fails\n\nWhen the refinery is unresponsive, merge branches manually:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/refinery/rig\ngit fetch origin\ngit branch -a  # See all polecat branches\ngit merge polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session> -m \"Merge: <description>\"\n# Resolve conflicts\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Merge: ... - resolved conflicts\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 2. Nudge Stuck Agents\n\nIf an agent is sitting idle:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig> && gt nudge refinery \"Process the merge queue\"\n```\n\n### 3. Use `bd` for Bead Operations\n\nWhen `gt` bead commands aren't available, use `bd` directly:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/.beads\nbd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"\nbd list --ready\nbd show <bead-id>\n```\n\n### 4. Check Polecat Branches for Completed Work\n\nIf a polecat completed but MQ isn't processing:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/refinery/rig\ngit branch -a | grep polecat  # Find work branches\ngit log --oneline <branch>     # See what was done\n```\n\n### 5. Doctor Fix for Setup Issues\n\nAfter setup or when things seem broken:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt doctor --fix --rig <rig-name>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 12.

Environment Discovery\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n**Command**: `gt --help`\n\n**Learning**: Gas Town has a comprehensive CLI with categories:\n- Work Management (bead, sling, convoy, close, done, etc.)\n- Agent Management (mayor, polecat, crew, witness, refinery, deacon)\n- Communication (nudge, mail, broadcast)\n- Services (daemon, up, down)\n- Workspace (rig, crew, init, install)\n- Diagnostics (status, doctor, feed, trail, audit)\n\n**Key Discovery**: `gt` commands are context-aware. Running from `~/gt/` (the HQ) vs from a rig directory changes behavior.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rig Setup\n\n### Rig Naming Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Rig names CANNOT contain hyphens.\n\n**Attempted**: `gt rig add website-cc ...`\n**Error**: `rig name \"website-cc\" contains invalid characters; hyphens, dots, and spaces are reserved for agent ID parsing`\n\n**Solution**: Use underscores: `gt rig add website_cc ...`\n\n**WHY**: Hyphens are used to parse agent IDs (e.g., `wcc-website_cc-witness`)\n\n### What `gt rig add` Creates\n\n```bash\ngt rig add website_cc https://github.com/gastownhall/website-cc.git --prefix wcc\n```\n\n**Result** (5.0 seconds):\n```\nwebsite_cc/\n├── config.json         # Rig configuration\n├── .repo.git/          # Shared bare repo for refinery+polecats\n├── .beads/             # Issue tracking (prefix: wcc)\n├── plugins/            # Rig-level plugins\n├── mayor/rig/          # Mayor's clone (main branch)\n├── refinery/rig/       # Refinery worktree (sees polecat branches)\n├── crew/               # Empty - for human workspaces\n├── witness/            # Witness agent directory\n└── polecats/           # Empty - for ephemeral workers\n```\n\n**Auto-created beads**:\n- `wcc-website_cc-witness` - Witness agent identity\n- `wcc-website_cc-refinery` - Refinery agent identity\n- `wcc-rig-website_cc` - Rig identity bead\n\n---\n\n## 3. Bead Creation\n\n### Two Approaches\n\n1. **Via Mayor**: `gt mayor attach` - Interactive chat to create beads\n2. **Via bd**: `bd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"` - Direct creation\n\n### Direct Creation with bd\n\n**Command**: `bd create [title] [flags]`\n\n**Useful flags**:\n- `--type` - epic, task, feature, bug, etc.\n- `--description` - Issue description\n- `--deps` - Dependencies (e.g., \"blocks:wcc-1\")\n- `--parent` - For hierarchical children\n- `--labels` - Add labels\n- `--priority` - P0-P4 (0=highest)\n- `--silent` - Output only ID (for scripting)\n\n### Hierarchical IDs\n\nChild beads use hierarchical IDs based on parent:\n- Epic: `wcc-60j`\n- Child tasks: `wcc-60j.1`, `wcc-60j.2`, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Work Dispatch (Sling)\n\n### The Sling Command\n\n**Command**: `gt sling <bead-id> <target>`\n\n**What it does**:\n1. Resolves target (rig → auto-spawn polecat)\n2. Creates polecat from name pool\n3. Attaches bead to polecat's hook\n4. Auto-creates convoy for tracking\n5. Sends start prompt to the polecat\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\ngt sling wcc-60j.1 website_cc\n# → Allocated polecat: obsidian\n# → Created convoy hq-cv-lwwwc\n# → Polecat obsidian spawned\n```\n\n### Polecat Name Pool\n\nPolecats get names from a pool: obsidian, quartz, jasper, onyx, etc.\n\n### Work Branches\n\nEach polecat works on its own branch:\n- Format: `polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session-id>`\n- Example: `polecat/obsidian/wcc-60j.1@mkmvss0x`\n\n### Adding Args\n\n```bash\ngt sling <bead> <target> --args \"natural language instructions\"\n```\n\nThe `--args` string provides additional context to the polecat.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Monitoring\n\n### Essential Commands\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `gt status` | Overall town status with all agents |\n| `gt convoy list` | List active convoys |\n| `gt convoy status <id>` | Detailed convoy progress |\n| `gt mq list <rig>` | Merge queue status |\n| `gt peek <rig>/<polecat>` | Real-time polecat output |\n\n### Status Symbols\n\n- `●` = Running\n- `○` = Stopped\n- `MQ:N` = N items in merge queue\n- `📬N` = N unread mail messages\n\n---\n\n## 6. What Worked\n\n### 1. Rig Setup with `gt rig add`\n- Quick and comprehensive setup (5 seconds)\n- Creates all necessary directories and agent beads automatically\n- Proper git structure with shared bare repo\n\n### 2. Direct Bead Creation with `bd create`\n- Fast way to create beads when you know the structure\n- Hierarchical IDs make relationships clear\n- `--parent` flag creates proper epic/child structure\n\n### 3. Parallel Work Dispatch with `gt sling`\n- Spawning multiple polecats for parallel work was effective\n- Auto-convoy creation provides visibility\n- Name pool is fun and memorable\n\n### 4. Polecat Autonomy\n- Polecats read context files (AGENTS.md, plan.md) and work independently\n- They create branches, commit code, and push to remote\n- No hand-holding needed once work is slung\n\n### 5. Build Scripts by Agents\n- Polecats created working build scripts (docs shredder, llms.txt generator)\n- Proper Astro configuration for static site generation\n- All 25 docs were processed correctly\n\n### 6. `gt peek` for Monitoring\n- Real-time visibility into what polecats are doing\n- Shows thinking, commands, and output\n- Essential for debugging\n\n---\n\n## 7. What Didn't Work\n\n### 1. Refinery Auto-Processing\n- **Issue**: Refinery kept crashing or sitting idle\n- **Symptom**: `gt refinery start website_cc` → \"timeout waiting for runtime prompt\"\n- **Impact**: Merge queue backed up with 3+ ready MRs\n- **Evidence**: Background tasks `gt rig start` and `gt refinery start` failed with exit code 1\n- **Workaround**: Manual git merge of polecat branches\n\n### 2. Rig Names with Hyphens\n- **Issue**: `gt rig add website-cc` failed\n- **Solution**: Use underscores instead (`website_cc`)\n\n### 3. Merge Conflicts from Parallel Work\n- **Issue**: Polecats modified same files (astro.config.mjs, index.astro)\n- **Symptom**: Merge conflicts when combining branches\n- **Learning**: Sequence dependent work OR design for parallel mergeability\n\n### 4. `gt ready --rig` Showing No Work\n- **Issue**: `gt ready --rig website_cc` returned \"No ready work across town\"\n- **But**: `bd list --ready` showed all beads as ready\n\n---\n\n## 8. Workarounds\n\n### Manual Merge When Refinery Fails\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/refinery/rig\ngit fetch origin\ngit branch -a  # See all polecat branches\ngit merge polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session> -m \"Merge: <description>\"\n# Resolve conflicts\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Merge: ... - resolved conflicts\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### Nudge Stuck Agents\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig> && gt nudge refinery \"Process the merge queue\"\n```\n\n### Use `bd` for Bead Operations\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/.beads\nbd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"\nbd list --ready\nbd show <bead-id>\n```\n\n### Doctor Fix for Setup Issues\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt doctor --fix --rig <rig-name>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Key Insights\n\n### The Gas Town Philosophy\n\n1. **GUPP**: \"If it's on your hook, YOU RUN IT.\" Agents execute immediately without confirmation.\n\n2. **Polecats are ephemeral**: They spawn, do work, submit to MQ, and disappear.\n\n3. **The Refinery is the gatekeeper**: All code goes through the merge queue.\n\n4. **Convoys provide visibility**: Every piece of work is tracked.\n\n### Recommended Workflow\n\n```\n1. Add rig:        gt rig add <name> <url> --prefix <prefix>\n2. Start services: gt rig start <name>\n3. Create epic:    bd create \"Project\" --type epic\n4. Create tasks:   bd create \"Task\" --type task --parent <epic>\n5. Sling work:     gt sling <bead> <rig>\n6. Monitor:        gt status && gt convoy list\n7. Check output:   gt peek <rig>/<polecat>\n8. Verify build:   cd ~/gt/<rig>/refinery/rig/src && npm run build\n```\n\n### What I Would Do Differently\n\n1. **Sequence dependent work**: Don't sling task 2 until task 1 is merged.\n2. **Keep tasks atomic**: Each bead should touch different files if possible.\n3. **Test refinery first**: Before slinging work, verify refinery is healthy.\n4. **Use smaller beads**: Break work into smaller pieces for easier merging.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Quick Reference\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```\n~/gt/                      # Town HQ\n├── .beads/                # Town-level issue tracking\n├── daemon/                # Daemon service\n├── deacon/                # Town-level watchdog\n├── mayor/                 # Cross-rig coordinator\n├── plugins/               # Town-level plugins\n└── <rig-name>/            # Each rig container\n    ├── .beads/            # Rig-level issues\n    ├── refinery/rig/      # Canonical clone\n    ├── mayor/rig/         # Mayor's clone\n    ├── crew/<name>/rig/   # Crew workspaces\n    ├── polecats/<name>/   # Ephemeral workers\n    └── witness/           # Witness agent\n```\n\n### Essential Commands\n\n| Task | Command |\n|------|---------|\n| Check town status | `cd ~/gt && gt status` |\n| List rigs | `cd ~/gt && gt rig list` |\n| Add rig | `gt rig add <name> <url> --prefix <prefix>` |\n| Check rig health | `gt doctor --fix --rig <name>` |\n| Create bead | `bd create \"Title\" --type task --parent <epic>` |\n| Dispatch work | `gt sling <bead-id> <rig-name>` |\n| Monitor polecats | `gt peek <rig>/<polecat>` |\n| Check MQ | `gt mq list <rig>` |\n| Nudge agent | `gt nudge refinery \"message\"` |\n| List convoys | `gt convoy list` |\n\n---\n\n## Results\n\n### Website Built Successfully\n\n- **Landing page**: Headline, 5 blog links, Discord CTA, X link, docs nav\n- **Docs page**: 25 markdown files processed via shredder\n- **Infrastructure**: robots.txt, llms.txt, privacy policy, SEO meta tags\n- **Build**: `npm run build` → static output in deploy/\n\n### Code Written by Agents\n\nAll code was produced by polecat agents via `gt sling` commands:\n- obsidian: Astro scaffold, infrastructure\n- quartz: Landing page\n- jasper: Docs landing page\n- onyx: Docs shredder tool\n\n### Time: ~20 minutes from rig creation to working build\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":426,"cache_read_input_tokens":133238,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":426,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXK52s5x2XD3ywRdVYzNg","type":"assistant","uuid":"627cb739-adbb-4207-bad8-81dc1dd91d01","timestamp":"2026-01-20T18:04:23.537Z"}

Workarounds\n\n### Manual Merge When Refinery Fails\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/refinery/rig\ngit fetch origin\ngit branch -a  # See all polecat branches\ngit merge polecat/<name>/<bead-id>@<session> -m \"Merge: <description>\"\n# Resolve conflicts\ngit add . && git commit -m \"Merge: ... - resolved conflicts\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### Nudge Stuck Agents\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig> && gt nudge refinery \"Process the merge queue\"\n```\n\n### Use `bd` for Bead Operations\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt/<rig>/.beads\nbd create \"Title\" --type task --description \"...\"\nbd list --ready\nbd show <bead-id>\n```\n\n### Doctor Fix for Setup Issues\n\n```bash\ncd ~/gt && gt doctor --fix --rig <rig-name>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Key Insights\n\n### The Gas Town Philosophy\n\n1. **GUPP**: \"If it's on your hook, YOU RUN IT.\" Agents execute immediately without confirmation.\n\n2. **Polecats are ephemeral**: They spawn, do work, submit to MQ, and disappear.\n\n3. **The Refinery is the gatekeeper**: All code goes through the merge queue.\n\n4. **Convoys provide visibility**: Every piece of work is tracked.\n\n### Recommended Workflow\n\n```\n1. Add rig:        gt rig add <name> <url> --prefix <prefix>\n2. Start services: gt rig start <name>\n3. Create epic:    bd create \"Project\" --type epic\n4. Create tasks:   bd create \"Task\" --type task --parent <epic>\n5. Sling work:     gt sling <bead> <rig>\n6. Monitor:        gt status && gt convoy list\n7. Check output:   gt peek <rig>/<polecat>\n8. Verify build:   cd ~/gt/<rig>/refinery/rig/src && npm run build\n```\n\n### What I Would Do Differently\n\n1. **Sequence dependent work**: Don't sling task 2 until task 1 is merged.\n2. **Keep tasks atomic**: Each bead should touch different files if possible.\n3. **Test refinery first**: Before slinging work, verify refinery is healthy.\n4. **Use smaller beads**: Break work into smaller pieces for easier merging.\n\n---\n\n## 10.
