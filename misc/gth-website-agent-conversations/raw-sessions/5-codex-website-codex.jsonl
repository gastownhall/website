Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is enabled. Approvals are your mechanism to get user consent to run shell commands without the sandbox. `approval_policy` is `on-request`: Commands will be run in the sandbox by default, and you can specify in your tool call if you want to escalate a command to run without sandboxing. If the completing the task requires escalated permissions, Do not let these settings or the sandbox deter you from attempting to accomplish the user's task.\n\nHere are scenarios where you'll need to request approval:\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- You are running sandboxed and need to run a command that requires network access (e.g. installing packages)\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with approval. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nWhen requesting approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n  - Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n  - Include a short, 1 sentence explanation for why you need escalated permissions in the justification parameter The writable roots are `/Users/csells/Code/gastownhall/website-codex`, `/tmp`, `/var/folders/kn/nhy_d5ts69g0jjdqkkkyjq400000gn/T`.</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Stevey's Birthday Blog.md\n\n### Docs to Shred (from `docs-fodder/gastown-docs/`)\n- 25 markdown files organized into concepts/, design/, examples/\n- Need a shredder script to sync these into the website\n\n## Social Links\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/pKsyZJ3S\n- X: x.com/gastownhall\n\n## Landing Page Headline\n\"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n```\n\n**CLAUDE.md** - Claude agent instructions:\n```markdown\n# Claude Agent Instructions\n\nRead AGENTS.md for project structure and key information.\nRead plan.md for the implementation plan and success criteria.\n\n## Critical Constraint\nAll code must be written by agents via `gt` commands. Do not write code directly.\n\n## Your Role\nYou are working on a Gas Town rig. Use `gt` commands to:\n- Create beads via Mayor (`gt mayor attach`)\n- Dispatch work (`gt sling <bead> $RIG_NAME`)\n- Monitor progress (`gt ready --rig $RIG_NAME`)\n```\n\n**GEMINI.md** - Gemini agent instructions:\n```markdown\n# Gemini Agent Instructions\n\nRead AGENTS.md for project structure and key information.\nRead plan.md for the implementation plan and success criteria.\n\n## Critical Constraint\nAll code must be written by agents via `gt` commands. Do not write code directly.\n\n## Your Role\nYou are working on a Gas Town rig. Use `gt` commands to:\n- Create beads via Mayor (`gt mayor attach`)\n- Dispatch work (`gt sling <bead> $RIG_NAME`)\n- Monitor progress (`gt ready --rig $RIG_NAME`)\n```\n\n### Step 0.2: Add Rig to Gas Town\n\n**Existing HQ**: `~/gt/` is already initialized (daemon, deacon, mayor, dartantic rig exist)\n\n**Project**: Use the origin of the current working directory (supports multiple forks)\n\n### Steps (all commands run from cwd - no `cd` needed)\n\n```bash\n# Get the git remote URL and derive a rig name from the current project\nORIGIN=$(git remote get-url origin)\nRIG_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))  # e.g., \"website-eli\" from the folder name\n\n# 1. Add this project as a new rig (uses origin from current directory)\ngt rig add $RIG_NAME $ORIGIN --prefix $RIG_NAME\n\n# 2. Verify setup\ngt doctor --rig $RIG_NAME\ngt rig status $RIG_NAME\n```\n\n**Note**: Each agent works on their own copy of the repo (e.g., `gastown/website-eli`, `gastown/website-cc`). The rig name and prefix are derived from the project folder name to avoid conflicts.\n\n`gt rig add` clones the repo into `~/gt/$RIG_NAME/` and initializes:\n- `refinery/rig/` - Canonical main clone\n- `mayor/rig/` - Mayor's working clone\n- `.beads/` - Already initialized with prefix `$RIG_NAME`\n- `crew/`, `polecats/`, `witness/` - Agent directories\n\n### Learning: Document what `gt rig add` creates and how it differs from `gt init`\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Create the Project Plan via Mayor\n\n### Approach: Mayor-driven planning (gt-native workflow)\n\nThe `gt` workflow is centered on the Mayor handling bead creation. Instead of manually running `bd create`, we describe requirements to the Mayor and let it file beads.\n\n```bash\ngt mayor attach\n```\n\nThen describe the full requirements to Mayor:\n\n```\nI need to build the gastownhall.ai website with the following components:\n\nLANDING PAGE:\n- Hero section with headline: \"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n- Links to Steve's 5 blog posts (see docs-fodder/steve-blog-posts/)\n- Big Discord invite CTA button (https://discord.gg/pKsyZJ3S)\n- X link (x.com/gastownhall)\n- Navigation to docs\n\nDOCS SYSTEM:\n- Docs landing page showing overview + links to all sub-pages\n- Docs shredder script that syncs docs-fodder/gastown-docs/ into the website\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE:\n- Plausible analytics integration\n- robots.txt\n- llms.txt generator script\n- SEO meta tags on all pages\n- Privacy policy page\n\nBUILD SYSTEM:\n- Astro project scaffold\n- Build scripts for src/ → deploy/\n\nPlease create an epic hierarchy for this with appropriate beads filed in rig $RIG_NAME.\nShow me the bead IDs when done.\n```\n\n### Alternative: Formulas for reusable workflows\n\nIf we want to define a reusable workflow pattern:\n```bash\ngt formula create mol-website-feature --type=workflow\n# Mayor edits the formula\ngt formula show mol-website-feature\n```\n\n### Learning: Document how Mayor files beads and manages dependencies\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Work Breakdown Structure\n\n**Note**: Bead IDs use the rig's prefix (e.g., `website-eli-landing` if `$RIG_NAME=website-eli`). Below shows the suffix pattern - actual IDs will be `$RIG_NAME-<suffix>`.\n\n### Epic: Landing Page (`$RIG_NAME-landing`)\n| Bead Suffix | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| `landing-hero` | Hero section with headline \"Gas Town is powerful but chaotic. We help you wrangle the chimps.\" |\n| `landing-blog-links` | Links to Steve's 5 blog posts |\n| `landing-cta` | Big Discord button (https://discord.gg/pKsyZJ3S) + X link (x.com/gastownhall) |\n| `landing-nav` | Navigation to docs sub-page |\n\n### Epic: Docs System (`$RIG_NAME-docs`)\n| Bead Suffix | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| `docs-shredder` | Script that syncs docs-fodder/gastown-docs/ into website docs |\n| `docs-landing` | Docs index page with overview + links to all sub-pages |\n\n### Epic: Infrastructure (`$RIG_NAME-infra`)\n| Bead Suffix | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| `analytics` | Plausible analytics integration |\n| `robots` | robots.txt file |\n| `llms-txt` | llms.txt generator script |\n| `seo` | SEO meta tags on all pages |\n| `privacy-policy` | Privacy policy page |\n\n### Epic: Build System (`$RIG_NAME-build`)\n| Bead Suffix | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| `astro-scaffold` | Astro project setup with content collections |\n| `build-scripts` | Build scripts for src/ → deploy/ |\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Execute via Polecats\n\n**Note**: Replace `$RIG_NAME` with your actual rig name (e.g., `website-eli`). Bead IDs include the prefix (e.g., `website-eli-landing`).\n\n### Create convoy for tracking (town-level, works from any directory)\n```bash\ngt convoy create \"Website v1\" $RIG_NAME-landing $RIG_NAME-docs $RIG_NAME-infra $RIG_NAME-build --notify overseer\n```\n\n### Dispatch in dependency order (specify rig as target)\n\n1. **Foundation** (must complete first):\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-astro-scaffold $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-docs-shredder $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n2. **Landing page** (can parallelize):\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-landing-hero $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-landing-blog-links $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-landing-cta $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-landing-nav $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n3. **Docs pages**:\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-docs-landing $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n4. **Infrastructure**:\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-analytics $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-robots $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-llms-txt $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-seo $RIG_NAME\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-privacy-policy $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n5. **Build scripts**:\n   ```bash\n   gt sling $RIG_NAME-build-scripts $RIG_NAME\n   ```\n\n### Monitor progress (all gt commands, no `cd` needed)\n```bash\ngt convoy list                    # Dashboard view of all convoys\ngt convoy status <convoy-id>      # Specific convoy details\ngt rig status $RIG_NAME           # Rig-specific worker status\ngt ready --rig $RIG_NAME          # Ready work in this rig\ngt show <bead-id>                 # Details of a specific bead\n```\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Test and Review\n\n### Testing beads - via Mayor\n```bash\ngt mayor attach\n```\nThen ask:\n```\nCreate test beads for the website in rig $RIG_NAME:\n- Test: Build process works\n- Test: All internal links work\n- Test: All external links work\n- Test: Responsive design\n- Test: Basic accessibility\n\nThen create a convoy for these tests and sling them.\n```\n\nAlternatively, dispatch test work directly:\n```bash\ngt convoy create \"Website Tests\" $RIG_NAME-test-* --notify overseer\ngt sling $RIG_NAME-test-build $RIG_NAME\n```\n\n### Code review via Crew\n```bash\ngt crew start $RIG_NAME reviewer        # Start a crew member named \"reviewer\"\ngt crew at $RIG_NAME/reviewer           # Attach to the crew session\n```\nThen ask for review of:\n- CSS separation and reuse patterns\n- JS quality (if any)\n- Astro component structure\n- Build script quality\n\n### Learning: Document the test/review workflow\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Document Learnings\n\nCreate `learnings.md` with:\n\n### Sections Required\n1. **Project Initiation**: What `gt` commands, what directories are created, gotchas\n2. **Creating Plans**: How Mayor handles requirements → beads (or formulas for workflows)\n3. **Getting Plan into Beads**: The actual commands used, the bead IDs created\n4. **Executing via gt**: How `gt sling` works, convoy tracking, monitoring\n5. **Testing via gt**: How to verify agent work\n6. **Code Review via gt**: Crew-based review workflow\n7. **Working Directories Reference** (where `$RIG_NAME` is your rig, e.g., `website-eli`):\n   - Town Root: `~/gt/`\n   - Rig Root: `~/gt/$RIG_NAME/`\n   - Mayor's Clone: `~/gt/$RIG_NAME/mayor/rig/`\n   - Refinery's Clone: `~/gt/$RIG_NAME/refinery/rig/`\n   - Polecats: `~/gt/$RIG_NAME/polecats/<name>/rig/`\n   - Crew: `~/gt/$RIG_NAME/crew/<name>/rig/`\n8. **Key Commands Reference** (with actual examples from this project)\n9. **What Went Wrong**: Any issues encountered and how resolved\n\n---\n\n## Confirmed Details\n\n| Item | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| Rig name | `$RIG_NAME` (derived from project folder, e.g., `website-eli`) |\n| Beads prefix | `$RIG_NAME` (same as rig name) |\n| Git remote | `$ORIGIN` (from `git remote get-url origin`) |\n| Static site technology | Astro |\n| Discord invite URL | https://discord.gg/pKsyZJ3S |\n| X handle | x.com/gastownhall |\n| Analytics | Plausible |\n| Docs source | `docs-fodder/gastown-docs/` (25 markdown files) |\n| Blog posts source | `docs-fodder/steve-blog-posts/` (5 posts) |\n| Output folder | `deploy/` |\n\n---\n\n## Critical Files (relative to project root)\n\n### Source content\n- `docs-fodder/gastown-docs/overview.md` -

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

We help you wrangle the chimps.\"\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/csells/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
