# Gas Town Documentation

> Comprehensive documentation for Gas Town, an open source orchestration layer for AI coding agents. This site covers installation, CLI usage, core concepts, architecture design, and examples.

## Quick Summary

- **What:** Orchestration layer for AI coding agents
- **Problem Solved:** Accountability, quality measurement, work routing, and agent coordination at scale
- **Key Concepts:** Convoys (batch work tracking), Polecats (ephemeral workers), Crew (persistent workers), Beads (atomic work units)
- **Core Principle:** GUPP - "If there is work on your Hook, YOU MUST RUN IT"
