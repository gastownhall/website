  "name": "Gas Town Hall Design Concept",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "theme": "Steampunk Industrial",

  "overview": {
    "description": "A Victorian-era industrial aesthetic that evokes the atmosphere of a 19th-century factory or workshop. The design combines the warmth of aged parchment and leather with the cold precision of brass machinery, creating a unique blend of organic and mechanical elements.",
    "mood": "Authoritative yet approachable, technical yet warm, industrial yet refined",
    "inspirations": [
      "Victorian-era industrial factories",
      "Brass clockwork and machinery",
      "Aged parchment and leather-bound books",
      "Steam-powered technology",
      "Industrial revolution craftsmanship"
    ]
  },

  "designPrinciples": {
    "materialHonesty": {
      "description": "Every surface should feel like a real material - metal plates, parchment, leather, or polished brass. Use gradients and shadows to simulate depth and physical presence.",
      "application": "Buttons look like pressed metal plates, cards feel like paper on a desk, dividers appear as industrial metal bars"
    },
    "functionalOrnamentation": {
      "description": "Decorative elements should reinforce the industrial theme while serving a purpose. Rivets mark boundaries, brass borders indicate interactive areas, metal bars separate content sections.",
      "application": "Rivets appear at corners of important containers, brass borders highlight interactive cards on hover, industrial dividers create visual rhythm"
    },
    "hierarchicalClarity": {
      "description": "Use the contrast between dark metal (header/footer) and light parchment (content) to create clear visual hierarchy. Important actions use bright brass, secondary elements use muted tones.",
      "application": "Dark header anchors the page, light content areas invite reading, brass CTAs draw attention"
    },
    "craftedMotion": {
      "description": "Animations should feel mechanical and precise, like well-oiled machinery. Movements ease out smoothly (like a steam valve releasing) rather than bouncing or springing.",
      "application": "Use ease-out-expo for most transitions, stagger animations like gears engaging, subtle pulsing for ambient elements"
    },
    "accessibleByDefault": {
      "description": "The design must work for everyone. Respect user preferences for reduced motion, maintain sufficient color contrast, and ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.",
      "application": "Reduced motion media query disables animations, focus states use visible brass outlines, text maintains WCAG AA contrast"
    }
  },

  "visualLanguage": {
    "surfaces": {
      "parchment": "Light, warm backgrounds (#E8DCC8, #F5E6D3) that feel like aged paper",
      "metalDark": "Deep brown-black gradients (#3E2723 to #5D4037) for header/footer bars",
      "metalLight": "Cream-to-tan gradients for secondary buttons and neutral surfaces",
      "brass": "Golden metallic gradients (#D4A574 to #8B6914) for primary actions"
    },
    "textures": {
      "insetShadow": "Subtle inner shadows create the feeling of recessed surfaces (pressed buttons, code blocks)",
      "dropShadow": "Soft outer shadows lift elements off the page (cards, modals)",
      "metalSheen": "Top-edge highlights (rgba white) simulate light catching polished metal"
    },
    "borders": {
      "brassAccent": "3-4px solid brass borders mark important boundaries and interactive states",
      "subtleBorder": "2px borders in muted brown (#8B7355) define card and input edges",
      "gradientBar": "Horizontal brass-to-copper gradients create elegant section dividers"
    },
    "decorativeElements": {
      "rivets": "Circular brass/bronze radial gradients with inset shadows, 10-16px diameter",
      "industrialBars": "Horizontal dark metal bars with brass top/bottom borders",
      "emDashes": "Brass-colored em dashes (—) flank important titles"
    }
  },

  "typography": {
    "philosophy": "Blend Victorian elegance with modern readability. Display text uses ornate serifs for gravitas, body text uses traditional serifs for comfort, code uses modern monospace for clarity.",
    "displayFont": {
      "family": "Cinzel",
      "fallback": "Times New Roman, serif",
      "usage": "Headings, navigation, buttons, banners",
      "characteristics": "Wide letter-spacing (0.05-0.15em), uppercase for nav/buttons, all-caps sparingly"
    },
    "bodyFont": {
      "family": "Crimson Text",
      "fallback": "Georgia, serif",
      "usage": "Paragraphs, descriptions, general content",
      "characteristics": "Comfortable 1.7 line-height, slightly larger base size (17px)"
    },
    "monoFont": {
      "family": "JetBrains Mono",
      "fallback": "Courier New, monospace",
      "usage": "Code blocks, inline code, technical identifiers",
      "characteristics": "0.9em relative size, distinct background treatment"
    },
    "scale": {
      "principle": "Use clamp() for fluid sizing that respects viewport width",
      "h1": "clamp(2rem, 4vw, 3rem)",
      "h2": "clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2rem)",
      "h3": "clamp(1.25rem, 2.5vw, 1.5rem)",
      "body": "1.0625rem (17px)",
      "small": "0.875rem (14px)"
    }
  },

  "colorPhilosophy": {
    "warmFoundation": "The palette is built on warm browns and tans that evoke aged paper and leather, creating a comfortable reading environment.",
    "metallicAccents": "Brass, bronze, and copper provide the industrial character. These should feel like actual metals - warm gold tones with subtle color variation.",
    "functionalColor": "Accent colors (deep rust red) draw attention to links and important actions. The neon green subline provides a modern tech contrast that makes the brand memorable.",
    "darkAnchors": "Deep brown-black tones ground the design at header and footer, creating a frame that contains the lighter content."
  },

  "spacingPhilosophy": {
    "generousWhitespace": "Content needs room to breathe. The industrial elements are dense, so surrounding whitespace is essential for balance.",
    "consistentRhythm": "Use a 4px base unit (0.25rem) scaled by powers of 2: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64px",
    "sectionSeparation": "Major sections separated by industrial bar dividers with 4rem (64px) vertical padding",
    "componentPadding": "Cards and containers use 2rem (32px) padding; buttons use proportional internal padding"
  },

  "interactionPhilosophy": {
    "hoverFeedback": "Interactive elements lift slightly (translateY -2 to -4px) and gain brass accents on hover, like metal catching light.",
    "pressFeedback": "Buttons compress slightly on press (scale 0.98, translateY 1px) simulating mechanical button depression.",
    "focusVisibility": "Focus states use brass outlines with soft glow halos - visible without being jarring.",
    "transitionTiming": "Fast for color/opacity changes (150ms), medium for transforms (250ms), slow for complex shadow transitions (400ms)"
  },

  "responsivePhilosophy": {
    "mobileFirst": "Core experience works on small screens; decorative elements (rivets, em-dashes) hide on mobile.",
    "contentPriority": "Navigation collapses to vertical stack, sidebars move above content, images scale down.",
    "touchTargets": "Buttons and links sized for comfortable touch (min 44px tap target).",
    "breakpoint": "768px is the primary breakpoint between mobile and desktop layouts."
  },

  "brandElements": {
    "logo": "Site name flanked by brass em-dashes: — Gas Town Hall —",
    "heroSubline": "Neon green (#39FF14) monospace text with dark outline stroke - the memorable brand accent",
    "industrialDivider": "Dark metal bar with brass borders and central rotating rivet"
  },

  "aiImplementationGuidelines": {
    "newComponents": "When creating new components, start with the surface (parchment or metal), add appropriate borders (brass for interactive, subtle for static), include material-honest shadows, and ensure hover/focus states use brass accents.",
    "colorSelection": "Pull from the defined palette. When in doubt, use brass for emphasis, muted brown for secondary, rust red for links/actions.",
    "animationApproach": "Use the defined easing curves. Entrance animations should fade + slide (fadeInUp/Down). Hover animations should lift + brighten. Keep durations short (150-400ms).",
    "typographyRules": "Cinzel for anything that needs authority (headings, buttons, navigation). Crimson Text for comfortable reading. JetBrains Mono only for code.",
    "accessibilityChecklist": "Include focus-visible states, respect prefers-reduced-motion, maintain 4.5:1 contrast for text, provide skip links."
