# Gas Town: The Missing Manual

A complete end-to-end guide to orchestrating AI coding agents with Gas Town.

**What you'll learn**: How to take a project idea from concept → plan → beads → agent execution → merged PR, using the full Gas Town workflow.

**Example project**: We'll build `linky`, a CLI tool that extracts and validates URLs from markdown files. This is a small-to-medium project that demonstrates the full workflow. Substitute your own project where indicated with `[YOUR PROJECT]`.

## 1. Mental Model: What Gas Town Actually Is

Gas Town is an orchestration system for AI coding agents. Think of it as:

- **A town** (`~/gt/`) where all your agent work happens
- **Rigs** are projects registered with the town (your repos)
- **Workers** are AI agents that do the actual coding

### Role Taxonomy

**Infrastructure Roles** (manage the system):

| Role | Description | Lifecycle |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Mayor** | Global coordinator at `mayor/` - initiates convoys, coordinates work | Singleton, persistent |
| **Deacon** | Background supervisor daemon (watchdog) | Singleton, persistent |
| **Witness** | Per-rig polecat lifecycle manager | One per rig, persistent |
| **Refinery** | Per-rig merge queue processor | One per rig, persistent |

**Worker Roles** (do actual project work):

| Role | Description | Lifecycle |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Polecat** | Ephemeral worker with own worktree | Transient, Witness-managed |
| **Crew** | Persistent worker with own clone | Long-lived, user-managed |
| **Dog** | Deacon helper for infrastructure tasks | Ephemeral, Deacon-managed |

**The Core Loop**:
```
You → Mayor → Beads (work items) → Convoy → Crew/Polecats → Code → Refinery → main branch
```

### Key Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **GUPP** (Gas Town Universal Propulsion Principle) | "If it's on your hook, YOU RUN IT" - agents execute immediately when given work |
| **MEOW** (Molecular Expression of Work) | Breaking large goals into detailed instructions. Supported by Beads, Epics, Formulas, and Molecules |
| **NDI** (Nondeterministic Idempotence) | Persistent Beads and oversight agents guarantee eventual completion even when individual operations fail |

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Beads** | The universal work item format - issues, tasks, epics, MRs (stored as JSONL) |
| **Hook** | A pinned bead for each agent - when work appears on your hook, GUPP says run it |
| **Convoy** | Primary work-order tracking related beads across rigs (`hq-cv-*` prefix) |
| **Swarm** | Ephemeral - "the workers currently on a convoy's issues" (not a persistent concept) |

---

## 2. The Directory Structure

Understanding where things live is crucial. Gas Town has a specific layout:

```
~/gt/                              # Town root (HQ)
├── .beads/                        # Town-level beads (hq-* prefix, includes convoys)
├── mayor/                         # Mayor config
│   ├── town.json                  # Town configuration
│   └── CLAUDE.md                  # Mayor context
├── deacon/                        # Deacon daemon
│   └── dogs/                      # Deacon helpers (NOT workers)
│       └── boot/                  # Health triage dog
│
└── <rig_name>/                    # Your project (e.g., "linky")
    ├── config.json                # Rig identity and settings
    ├── .beads/ → mayor/rig/.beads # (symlink or redirect)
    ├── .repo.git/                 # Bare repo (shared by all worktrees)
    │
    ├── mayor/rig/                 # Mayor's worktree (canonical beads live here)
    │   ├── .beads/                # THE source of truth for this rig's beads
    │   └── CLAUDE.md              # Per-rig mayor context
    │
    ├── refinery/                  # Refinery settings parent
    │   ├── .claude/settings.json
    │   └── rig/                   # Worktree on main (merge target)
    │
    ├── witness/                   # Monitors polecats (NO git clone)
    │   └── .claude/settings.json
    │
    ├── crew/                      # Persistent workers
    │   ├── .claude/settings.json  # Shared by all crew (via traversal)
    │   ├── joe/rig/               # Crew member "joe"'s worktree
    │   └── max/rig/               # Crew member "max"'s worktree
    │
    └── polecats/                  # Ephemeral workers (come and go)
        ├── .claude/settings.json  # Shared by all polecats
        └── Toast/rig/             # Polecat "Toast"'s worktree
```

**Critical Insights**:
- The rig root is a container, NOT a clone
- `.repo.git/` is bare - refinery and polecats are worktrees sharing refs
- Per-rig `mayor/rig/` holds canonical `.beads/`, others inherit via redirect
- Settings are placed in parent dirs (not git clones) so Claude finds them via upward traversal

## 3. Phase 1: Town Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Check | Install |
|------|---------|-------|---------|
| **Go** | 1.24+ | `go version` | See [golang.org](https://go.dev/doc/install) |
| **Git** | 2.20+ | `git --version` | `brew install git` (macOS) |
| **Beads** | latest | `bd version` | `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest` |
| **tmux** | 3.0+ | `tmux -V` | `brew install tmux` (macOS) |
| **Claude Code** | latest | `claude --version` | See [claude.ai/claude-code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) |

### Install Gas Town

```bash
# From anywhere
go install github.com/steveyegge/gastown/cmd/gt@latest
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest

# Verify installation
gt version
bd version
```

If `gt` is not found, ensure `$GOPATH/bin` (usually `~/go/bin`) is in your PATH:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or equivalent
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
```

### Create Your Town (HQ)

```bash
# Create a Gas Town workspace (HQ)
gt install ~/gt
```

**Expected output**:
```
Creating Gas Town workspace at /Users/you/gt
  ✓ Created mayor/
  ✓ Created deacon/
  ✓ Created .beads/
  ✓ Initialized configuration

Gas Town installed successfully.
Run 'cd ~/gt && gt doctor' to verify.
```

**[YOUR PROJECT]**: You can install to any path, but `~/gt` is conventional.

### Verify Installation

```bash
cd ~/gt
gt doctor
```

**Expected output** (healthy):
```
Gas Town Health Check
=====================
✓ Town root: /Users/you/gt
✓ Config valid
✓ Mayor directory exists
✓ Deacon directory exists
✓ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set

Status: HEALTHY
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: If you see "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set", export it:
> ```bash
> export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
> ```
> Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) to persist.

---

## 4. Phase 2: Adding Your Project as a Rig

A **rig** is a project registered with Gas Town. This creates the directory structure and clones your repo.

### Create Your Project Repository First

If you don't have a repo yet:

```bash
# Outside of Gas Town - create repo on GitHub first, then:
cd ~/code  # or wherever you keep projects
mkdir linky && cd linky
git init
echo "# Linky - URL extractor for markdown" > README.md
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
gh repo create linky --public --source=. --push
```

**[YOUR PROJECT]**: Replace `linky` with your project name and create your own repo.

### Add the Rig to Gas Town

```bash
# CRITICAL: Must be in ~/gt for this command
cd ~/gt

# Add the rig
gt rig add linky https://github.com/yourusername/linky.git
```

**Syntax**:
```bash
gt rig add <name> <url>
```

> ⚠️ **Warning - Naming Rules**:
> - Rig names: Use underscores, NOT hyphens (`my_project`, not `my-project`)
> - Beads prefix: Derived from rig name, can be configured separately
>
> **Why?** Hyphens are reserved for agent ID parsing internally.

**Expected output**:
```
Adding rig 'linky'...
  Cloning https://github.com/yourusername/linky.git
  Creating bare repo at linky/.repo.git
  Creating mayor worktree at linky/mayor/rig
  Creating refinery worktree at linky/refinery/rig

Rig 'linky' added successfully.
```

### Verify the Rig

```bash
# Still in ~/gt
gt rig list
```

**Expected output**:
```
Registered Rigs
===============
linky    https://github.com/yourusername/linky.git
```

```bash
# Detailed health check
gt doctor --rig linky
```

### Understanding What Just Happened

When you added the rig, Gas Town:
1. Created `~/gt/linky/` directory structure
2. Cloned your repo as a bare repo (`.repo.git`)
3. Created worktrees for mayor and refinery
4. Set up the beads directory at `linky/mayor/rig/.beads/`

---

## 5. Phase 3: Planning with the Mayor

The **Mayor** is your primary interface for planning work. The Mayor is the Chief-of-Staff responsible for initiating convoys, coordinating work distribution, and notifying users.

### Operational Modes

Gas Town supports two modes:

| Mode | When to Use | Agents Run In |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Minimal** (no daemon) | Testing, simple workflows, manual control | Manual `claude` sessions |
| **Full Stack** (with daemon) | Production workflows, multiple concurrent agents | tmux sessions via daemon |

### Start the Mayor (Full Stack Mode)

```bash
# From ~/gt
cd ~/gt

# Start the daemon (manages agent lifecycle)
gt daemon start

# Attach to Mayor
gt mayor attach
```

**Or in one step:**
```bash
gt start   # Starts daemon + Mayor if not running
```

This opens a tmux session with the Mayor. You're now in a conversation with an AI that understands Gas Town.

**Expected**: You'll see a tmux pane with a Claude conversation interface.

### Describe Your Project

Talk to the Mayor naturally. Here's an example conversation:

```
You: I want to build linky, a CLI tool in Go that:
     1. Takes a markdown file or directory as input
     2. Extracts all URLs from the markdown
     3. Validates each URL (checks if reachable)
     4. Outputs a report of broken links

     Can you help me plan this out and create the work items?
```

**Mayor response** (abbreviated):
```
I'll help you plan linky. Let me break this down into epics and tasks.

Based on your requirements, I see these major components:
1. CLI Framework (argument parsing, help text)
2. Markdown Parser (extract URLs)
3. URL Validator (HTTP checks, concurrency)
4. Reporter (output formatting)

Let me create the beads for this...

Created:
- linky-a1b2c: Epic: Linky CLI Tool
  - linky-d3e4f: Task: Set up Go project structure
  - linky-g5h6i: Task: Implement CLI argument parsing
  - linky-j7k8l: Task: Build markdown URL extractor
  - linky-m9n0p: Task: Create concurrent URL validator
  - linky-q1r2s: Task: Implement report generator
  - linky-t3u4v: Task: Add error handling and edge cases
  - linky-w5x6y: Task: Write tests
```

### Alternative: Create Beads Directly

If you already know your task breakdown, skip the conversation and create beads directly:

```bash
# From ~/gt (or you can ask any agent to run these)
cd ~/gt/linky/mayor/rig

# Create epic
bd create --title "Epic: Linky CLI Tool" --type epic

# Note the ID it returns (e.g., linky-a1b2c), then create tasks:
bd create --title "Set up Go project structure" --type task
bd create --title "Implement CLI argument parsing" --type task
bd create --title "Build markdown URL extractor" --type task
bd create --title "Create concurrent URL validator" --type task
bd create --title "Implement report generator" --type task

# Link tasks to epic using dependencies
bd dep add linky-d3e4f linky-a1b2c  # child depends on parent
```

**Expected output** (for each create):
```
Created bead: linky-d3e4f
  Title: Set up Go project structure
  Type: task
  Status: open
```

> 💡 **Tip**: The Mayor is better for exploratory planning. Direct `bd create` is faster when you know exactly what you want.

### View Your Plan

```bash
# From anywhere in the rig
cd ~/gt/linky/mayor/rig

# List all beads
bd list

# List just tasks
bd list --type task

# List with status
bd list --status=open

# Show details of a specific bead
bd show linky-a1b2c

# Show ready work (no blockers)
bd ready
```

---

## 6. Phase 4: Understanding Beads

**Beads** are the universal work item in Gas Town. Everything is a bead: issues, tasks, epics, merge requests, convoys. They're stored as git-backed JSONL files.

### Bead Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `epic` | Large feature grouping | "Epic: User Authentication" |
| `task` | Discrete implementable work | "Implement login endpoint" |
| `bug` | Something broken | "Fix null pointer in parser" |
| `mr` | Merge request (created by polecats) | "MR: polecat/Toast/linky-d3e4f" |
| `chore` | Maintenance work | "Update dependencies" |

### Bead Lifecycle

```
open → in_progress → closed
         ↓
      blocked (optional)
```

### Key Bead Commands

```bash
# Always run from within a rig worktree (e.g., ~/gt/linky/mayor/rig)

# Create
bd create --title "My task" --type task

# List
bd list                      # All beads
bd list --type task          # Just tasks
bd list --status=open        # Just open items
bd ready                     # Work with no blockers (ready to start)

# Update
bd update linky-abc --status=in_progress    # Claim work
bd dep add linky-child linky-parent         # Add dependency

# Close
bd close linky-abc                          # Mark done

# Details
bd show linky-abc                           # Full details

# Sync (push/pull changes across worktrees)
bd sync
```

### Beads Routing

Gas Town routes beads commands based on issue ID prefix automatically:

```bash
bd show linky-xyz    # Routes to linky rig's beads
bd show hq-abc       # Routes to town-level beads
bd show bd-123       # Routes to beads rig (if you have one)
```

Routes are defined in `~/gt/.beads/routes.jsonl`.

### The `bd ready` Command

This is your best friend. It shows work that's unblocked and ready to start:

```bash
bd ready
```

**Expected output**:
```
Ready work (no blockers, status=open):
  linky-d3e4f  task  Set up Go project structure
  linky-g5h6i  task  Implement CLI argument parsing
  linky-j7k8l  task  Build markdown URL extractor
```

There's also a town-level version:

```bash
gt ready   # Show work ready across entire town
```

---

## 7. Phase 5: Working with Crew

**Crew** are persistent, named workers for each rig. They're your "senior developers":
- Have ongoing context about the project
- Push directly to main (no refinery needed)
- Ideal for exploratory work, design, and foundation building

### Crew vs Polecats

| Aspect | Crew | Polecat |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Lifecycle** | Persistent (user controls) | Transient (Witness controls) |
| **Monitoring** | None | Witness watches, nudges, recycles |
| **Work assignment** | Human-directed or self-assigned | Slung via `gt sling` |
| **Git state** | Pushes to main directly | Works on branch, Refinery merges |
| **Cleanup** | Manual | Automatic on completion |
| **Identity** | `<rig>/crew/<name>` | `<rig>/polecats/<name>` |

### Add a Crew Member

```bash
# From ~/gt
cd ~/gt

# Add a crew member named "joe" to the linky rig
gt crew add linky joe
```

**Expected output**:
```
Adding crew member 'joe' to rig 'linky'...
  Creating worktree at linky/crew/joe/rig
  Branch: main

Crew member 'joe' ready.
```

### Attach to Crew

```bash
# From ~/gt
gt start crew linky/joe
# Or if already started:
gt crew attach linky/joe
```

This opens a tmux session with the crew member. You're now talking to an AI that:
- Has access to the codebase
- Can read/write files
- Can run commands
- Understands the beads in the project

### Give Crew Work

**Option 1: Conversational**
```
You: Please work on linky-d3e4f (Set up Go project structure).
     Create a standard Go project layout with:
     - cmd/linky/main.go
     - internal/extractor/
     - internal/validator/
     - go.mod
```

**Option 2: Sling the bead (hooks it so they can't forget)**
```bash
# From ~/gt (in a different terminal)
gt sling linky-d3e4f linky/joe
```

When you sling to crew, the work is "hooked" to them. They'll see it when they run `gt hook`.

### Monitor Crew Work

```bash
# From ~/gt
gt peek linky/joe           # See their output
gt peek linky/joe -n 100    # Last 100 lines
```

### Crew Pushes to Main

When crew completes work, they commit and push directly to main. They signal completion via `gt done`:

```
Crew (joe): I've created the project structure. Committing and pushing to main...

[joe commits: "feat: initial project structure"]
[joe pushes to origin/main]
[joe runs: gt done]

Done. linky-d3e4f complete.
```

### Session Management for Crew

```bash
# Hand off to a fresh session (preserves hook, refreshes context)
gt handoff

# Talk to predecessor sessions (full context)
gt seance
gt seance --talk <session-id>
gt seance --talk <session-id> -p "Where did you leave off?"
```

### When to Use Crew vs. Polecats

**Use Crew When**:
- Exploratory work
- Long-running projects
- Work requiring human judgment
- Tasks where you want direct control
- Building foundation/scaffold

**Use Polecats When**:
- Discrete, well-defined tasks
- Batch work (tracked via convoys)
- Parallelizable work
- Work that benefits from supervision

> ⚠️ **Critical Pattern**: For new projects, **always use Crew first** to build the foundation. Polecats can't coordinate well on greenfield work.

---

## 8. Phase 6: Polecats and Convoys

**Polecats** are ephemeral swarm workers. They:
- Spawn, do one task, submit MR, self-destruct
- Work on branches (not main)
- Require the Refinery to merge their work
- Are great for batch parallel execution

### The Polecat Lifecycle (Three Layers)

Polecats have three distinct lifecycle layers:

| Layer | Component | Lifecycle | Persistence |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Session** | Claude (tmux pane) | Ephemeral | Cycles per step/handoff |
| **Sandbox** | Git worktree | Until nuke | Persists through session cycles |
| **Slot** | Name from pool | Until nuke | Released only on completion |

**Key Insight**: Session cycling is **normal operation**, not failure. The polecat continues working—only the Claude context refreshes.

### The Three Operating States

Polecats have exactly three states. **There is NO idle pool**:

| State | Description | What went wrong |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Working** | Actively doing assigned work | Normal operation |
| **Stalled** | Session stopped mid-work | Interrupted/crashed, never nudged |
| **Zombie** | Completed work but failed to die | `gt done` failed during cleanup |

When a polecat completes its work:
1. Signals completion via `gt done`
2. Exits its session immediately (no idle waiting)
3. Requests its own nuke (self-delete)

### Prerequisites for Polecats

Before using polecats:
1. ✅ Foundation code exists on main (built by Crew)
2. ✅ Tasks are well-defined and independent
3. ✅ Refinery is running (or you're ready for manual merges)

### Convoys: The Primary Tracking Unit

A **convoy** is how you track batched work. Even single issues should go through convoys for dashboard visibility.

```bash
# From ~/gt

# Create a convoy tracking multiple issues
gt convoy create "CLI Features" linky-g5h6i linky-j7k8l linky-m9n0p --notify human

# Check progress
gt convoy status hq-cv-xyz

# List all active convoys (the dashboard)
gt convoy list

# Include landed convoys
gt convoy list --all
```

**Convoy vs Swarm**:

| Concept | Persistent? | ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| **Convoy** | Yes | `hq-cv-*` | Tracking unit. What you create, track, get notified about. |
| **Swarm** | No | None | Ephemeral. "The workers currently on this convoy's issues." |

### Sling Work to Polecats

```bash
# From ~/gt
cd ~/gt

# Sling a single task (auto-creates convoy for visibility)
gt sling linky-g5h6i linky
```

**Expected output**:
```
Slinging linky-g5h6i to rig linky...
  Creating convoy: "Work: linky-g5h6i"
  Spawning polecat 'Toast' on linky
  Branch: polecat/Toast/linky-g5h6i
  Hooked: linky-g5h6i (Implement CLI argument parsing)

Polecat Toast is working. Monitor with: gt peek linky/Toast
```

### Override Agent Runtime

```bash
# Use a different agent/model for this sling
gt sling linky-g5h6i linky --agent codex
gt sling linky-g5h6i linky --agent claude-haiku
```

### Monitor Polecats

```bash
# See what's happening
gt peek linky/Toast

# See all active sessions
gt session list

# Detailed view
gt peek linky/Toast -n 150

# Send a nudge (synchronous message)
gt nudge linky/Toast "What's your status?"

# Broadcast to all workers
gt broadcast linky "Heads up: API changed, rebase before pushing"
```

### Sling Ad-Hoc Work (No Bead)

Sometimes you want a polecat to do something without a pre-existing bead:

```bash
gt sling shiny linky --args "Add a --verbose flag to the CLI"
```

The `shiny` keyword means "ad-hoc task". The polecat will:
1. Create a bead for this work
2. Do the work
3. Submit MR

### Monitor Convoy Progress

```bash
# Check convoy status
gt convoy status hq-cv-xyz
# Or by name:
gt convoy status "CLI Features"
```

**Expected output**:
```
🚚 hq-cv-xyz: CLI Features

  Status:    ●
  Progress:  1/3 completed

  Tracked Issues:
    ✓ linky-g5h6i: Implement CLI argument parsing [task]
    ○ linky-j7k8l: Build markdown URL extractor [task]
    ○ linky-m9n0p: Create concurrent URL validator [task]
```

### What Polecats Produce

When a polecat finishes via `gt done`:
1. Pushes branch to origin
2. Submits work to merge queue (MR bead)
3. Requests self-nuke
4. Exits immediately

The MR bead then lives in the merge queue. **The polecat is GONE**—work now exists in the MQ, not in the polecat.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Polecats create MR beads but **don't merge them**. That's the Refinery's job (or yours, manually).

---

## 9. Phase 7: The Refinery and PRs

The **Refinery** is the merge queue processor. It takes polecat branches and merges them into main.

### Start the Refinery

```bash
# From ~/gt
gt refinery start linky
```

**Expected output**:
```
Starting refinery for rig 'linky'...
  Worktree: linky/refinery/rig
  Watching for MR beads...

Refinery running. Check queue with: gt mq list linky
```

### Check the Merge Queue

```bash
gt mq list linky
```

**Expected output**:
```
Merge Queue: linky
==================
linky-mr-abc123  pending   polecat/Toast/linky-g5h6i  CLI argument parsing
linky-mr-def456  pending   polecat/Rust/linky-j7k8l   URL extractor
linky-mr-ghi789  merging   polecat/Nitro/linky-m9n0p  URL validator

Queue depth: 3
Currently merging: linky-mr-ghi789
```

### The Refinery Flow

```
MR bead created → Refinery picks it up →
  Fetches branch → Attempts rebase + merge →
  If clean: merge + push + close MR bead →
  If conflict: spawn FRESH polecat to re-implement (never send back to original)
```

### When Refinery Succeeds

The MR beads are closed, main has all the code, and the convoy lands (triggering notification).

### Manual Merge (When Refinery Fails)

The Refinery frequently has issues. Based on all agent sessions, expect to do manual merges sometimes.

> ⚠️ **Common Refinery Issues**:
> - "timeout waiting for runtime prompt"
> - "permission denied" on git operations
> - Missing patrol molecule
> - Conflicts requiring human resolution

**Manual merge process**:

```bash
# Go to the refinery worktree
cd ~/gt/linky/refinery/rig

# Fetch all branches
git fetch origin

# See pending polecat branches
git branch -r | grep polecat

# Merge a specific branch
git merge --ff-only origin/polecat/Toast/linky-g5h6i

# If that fails (not fast-forward), use regular merge
git merge origin/polecat/Toast/linky-g5h6i -m "Merge polecat/Toast/linky-g5h6i"

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Close the MR bead manually
bd close linky-mr-abc123
```

**Shell script for batch manual merges**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save as: ~/gt/scripts/manual-merge.sh

RIG=${1:-linky}
cd ~/gt/$RIG/refinery/rig

echo "Fetching all branches..."
git fetch origin

echo "Polecat branches:"
git branch -r | grep polecat

echo ""

### Your Final PR

After all polecats have merged (via Refinery or manually), your main branch has all the code. To create a GitHub PR for final review:

```bash
# In the refinery worktree (on main)
cd ~/gt/linky/refinery/rig

# Create a feature branch from all this work (optional, for PR)
git checkout -b feature/linky-mvp

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/linky-mvp
gh pr create --title "Linky MVP" --body "Built with Gas Town"
```

## 10. Complete Workflow: Putting It All Together

Here's the entire flow as a single reference:

### Phase 1: Setup (One-time)

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/steveyegge/gastown/cmd/gt@latest
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest

# Create town
gt install ~/gt
cd ~/gt
gt doctor
```

### Phase 2: Add Rig

```bash
cd ~/gt
gt rig add linky https://github.com/you/linky.git
gt doctor --rig linky
```

### Phase 3: Plan with Mayor

```bash
cd ~/gt
gt daemon start
gt mayor attach
# "Create epics and tasks for building a URL extractor CLI..."
# Or: bd create directly
```

### Phase 4: Build Foundation with Crew

```bash
cd ~/gt
gt crew add linky joe
gt start crew linky/joe
# "Build the project scaffold: go.mod, directory structure, main.go..."
# Crew pushes to main when done, runs gt done
```

### Phase 5: Verify Foundation

```bash
cd ~/gt/linky/mayor/rig
git pull
ls -la  # Should see scaffold
bd list  # Should see some tasks closed
```

### Phase 6: Dispatch Parallel Work via Convoy

```bash
cd ~/gt

# Start refinery (or skip and plan to merge manually)
gt refinery start linky

# Create convoy and sling
gt convoy create "Features" linky-j7k8l linky-m9n0p linky-q1r2s --notify human
gt sling linky-j7k8l linky
gt sling linky-m9n0p linky
gt sling linky-q1r2s linky
```

### Phase 7: Monitor and Merge

```bash
# Monitor polecats
gt peek linky/Toast
gt convoy status "Features"
gt convoy list

# Check merge queue
gt mq list linky

# If refinery stalls, merge manually
cd ~/gt/linky/refinery/rig
git fetch origin
git merge --ff-only origin/polecat/Toast/linky-j7k8l
git push origin main
bd close linky-mr-xyz
```

### Phase 8: Final PR

```bash
cd ~/gt/linky/refinery/rig
git checkout -b feature/complete-build
git push -u origin feature/complete-build
gh pr create --title "Linky: Complete Build" --body "..."
```

## 11. Troubleshooting Appendix

### Error: "not in a Gas Town workspace"

**Cause**: Running `gt` commands from outside `~/gt`

**Fix**:
```bash
cd ~/gt
# Then run your command
```

### Error: Rig name contains invalid characters

**Cause**: Used hyphen in rig name

**Example**:
```
gt rig add my-project ...
Error: rig name "my-project" contains invalid characters; hyphens are reserved
```

**Fix**: Use underscores
```bash
gt rig add my_project https://...
```

### Error: timeout waiting for runtime prompt

**Cause**: Refinery patrol molecule not working

**Fix**: Manual merge (see Phase 7 above)

### Error: fatal: couldn't find remote ref polecat/...

**Cause**: Running `bd sync` before branch is pushed

**Fix**: Push branch first, or skip sync
```bash
git push origin polecat/Toast/linky-abc
bd sync
```

### Polecat hooks are empty

**Cause**: Work wasn't properly hooked on spawn

**Fix**: Use `gt nudge` as fallback
```bash
gt nudge linky/Toast "Your task is linky-abc: Implement X. Start working."
```

### Multiple polecats doing same work

**Cause**: No coordinator, all saw same ready work

**Fix**: Use Crew as coordinator for dependent tasks, or serialize slinging

### Refinery permission denied on git reset

**Cause**: Refinery can't hard reset (filesystem permissions)

**Fix**: Manual merge in refinery worktree (see Phase 7)

### Crew changes not visible to polecats

**Cause**: Crew pushed to main but polecats branched before

**Fix**:
1. Wait for current polecats to finish
2. Have them rebase: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`
3. Or just let refinery handle merge conflicts

### Stale beads after work is done

**Cause**: Beads not synced across worktrees

**Fix**:
```bash
bd sync  # In the worktree that needs update
```

### How to reset a stuck rig

```bash
cd ~/gt

# Remove and re-add the rig
gt rig remove linky
gt rig add linky https://github.com/you/linky.git

# Note: This loses local worktree changes but preserves git history
```

### How to kill a stuck polecat

```bash
# Find the session
gt session list

# Stop it
gt session stop linky/Toast

# Or nuke it entirely (removes worktree + branch)
gt polecat nuke Toast
```

### Escalations

When something needs human attention:

```bash
gt escalate "topic"              # Default: MEDIUM severity
gt escalate -s CRITICAL "msg"    # Urgent, immediate attention
gt escalate -s HIGH "msg"        # Important blocker
```

### How to clear all polecats

```bash
# Ask the Mayor or a crew member
gt mayor attach
# "Clear all polecats on the linky rig"

# Or emergency stop all
gt stop --rig linky
```

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with this workflow:

1. **Explore molecules** for repeatable multi-step workflows (`bd formula list`, `bd cook`, `bd mol pour`)
2. **Set up Witness** for automatic polecat monitoring (`gt witness start`)
3. **Configure Deacon** for automated cleanup (`gt deacon start`)
4. **Configure agents** for your preferred runtimes (`gt config agent list`, `gt config agent set`)
5. **Try multi-rig** with the Mayor managing several projects
6. **Use the dashboard** (`gt dashboard`) for visual convoy tracking
