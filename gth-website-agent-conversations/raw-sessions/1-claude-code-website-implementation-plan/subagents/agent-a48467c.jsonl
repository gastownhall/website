I now have comprehensive information about the gt CLI tool. Let me compile my findings:\n\n## Comprehensive Gas Town (gt) CLI Tool Exploration\n\n### 1. **What is gastown/gt?**\n\nGas Town (gt) is a **multi-agent AI coordination framework** that manages distributed teams of AI agents working collaboratively on shared codebases. It's a sophisticated orchestration system designed to:\n\n- Coordinate multiple AI agents spawning across projects\n- Distribute work through issue assignment and tracking\n- Enable cross-rig (cross-project) collaboration\n- Manage agent lifecycle, communication, and work completion\n- Provide persistent tracking and recovery mechanisms\n\n**Version:** 0.4.0 (dev)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Available Commands (Comprehensive List)**\n\nThe gt CLI is organized into 9 major categories:\n\n#### **Work Management** (Core task operations)\n- **bead** - Manage beads (work units/issues) across repositories\n- **cat** - Display bead content\n- **close** - Close one or more beads\n- **commit** - Git commit with automatic agent identity\n- **convoy** - Track batches of work across rigs (primary tracking unit)\n- **done** - Signal work ready for merge queue\n- **formula** - Manage workflow formulas (reusable templates)\n- **gate** - Gate coordination commands\n- **handoff** - Hand off to fresh session, work continues from hook\n- **hook** - Show or attach work on your hook (durability primitive)\n- **mol** - Agent molecule workflow commands\n- **mq/mr** - Merge queue operations\n- **orphans** - Find lost polecat work\n- **park** - Park work on a gate for async resumption\n- **ready** -

top-level workspace):**\n   ```bash\n   gt install ~/gt                              # Create HQ at ~/gt\n   gt install . --name my-workspace             # Initialize current dir\n   gt install ~/gt --git                        # Also init git\n   gt install ~/gt --github=user/repo           # Create GitHub repo\n   gt install ~/gt --shell                      # Install shell integration\n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize a Rig (project container):**\n   ```bash\n   gt init                                      # Initialize current directory as a rig\n   gt init --force                              # Reinitialize existing structure\n   ```\n   This creates: polecats/, witness/, refinery/, mayor/ directories and updates .git/info/exclude\n\n3. **Add a new rig to workspace:**\n   ```bash\n   gt rig add <rig-name>\n   ```\n\n#### **Creating and Managing Formulas (Reusable Workflows):**\n\nFormulas are TOML/JSON workflow templates with steps and variables:\n```bash\ngt formula list                        # List all available formulas\ngt formula show shiny                  # Show formula details\ngt formula create my-workflow          # Create new formula template\ngt formula run my-formula --var key=value    # Execute a formula\n```\n\nSearch paths: `.beads/formulas/` → `~/.beads/formulas/` → `$GT_ROOT/.beads/formulas/`\n\n#### **Executing Work (THE Unified Dispatch Command - \"sling\"):**\n\nThe **`gt sling`** command is THE command for assigning work:\n\n```bash\n# Sling to self\ngt sling gt-abc                              # Assign to current agent\n\n# Sling to different targets\ngt sling gt-abc crew                         # Assign to crew worker\ngt sling gt-abc gastown                      # Auto-spawn polecat in rig\ngt sling gt-abc greenplace/Toast             # Specific polecat\ngt sling gt-abc mayor                        # Assign to Mayor\ngt sling gt-abc deacon/dogs                  # Auto-dispatch to idle dog\n\n# Spawning options\ngt sling gt-abc greenplace --create          # Create polecat if missing\ngt sling gt-abc greenplace --force           # Ignore unread mail\n\n# With instructions\ngt sling gt-abc --args \"patch release\"       # Natural language args\ngt sling gt-abc --subject \"Fix\" --message \"Details\"  # With context\n\n# Formula dispatch (pour + wisp + attach + nudge)\ngt sling mol-release mayor/                  # Cook formula + dispatch\n\n# Batch dispatch\ngt sling gt-abc gt-def gt-ghi gastown        # Multiple beads to rig\n\n# Dry run\ngt sling gt-abc --dry-run                    # Show what would be done\n```\n\n#### **Work Tracking with Convoys:**\n\nConvoys are the persistent tracking units for batches of work:\n\n```bash\ngt convoy create hq-001 --issues gt-abc,gt-def    # Create convoy\ngt convoy list                                    # List all convoys\ngt convoy status hq-001                           # Show progress\ngt convoy add hq-001 --issues gt-ghi              # Add to existing\n```\n\nAuto-created when slinging single issues (unless `--no-convoy` specified).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **What is a \"Bead\"?**\n\nA **bead** is the fundamental unit of work in Gas Town - essentially a **work item or issue**.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- Can be attached to a hook (personal work queue)\n- Can be slang (assigned) to agents\n- Survives session restarts, context compaction, and handoffs\n- Tracked by convoys\n- Can have molecules (step-by-step workflows) attached\n\n**Bead Operations:**\n```bash\ngt bead show <bead-id>              # Show bead details\ngt bead move <bead-id> <repo>       # Move to different repository\ngt hook <bead-id>                   # Attach bead to your hook\ngt show <bead-id>                   # Show issue details\ngt sling <bead-id> <target>         # Dispatch to agent\ngt cat <bead-id>                    # Display bead content\n```\n\n**Status Examples:**\n- Pending - waiting for assignment\n- In Progress - being worked on by an agent\n- Ready for MR - completed, ready for merge queue\n- Closed - completed and merged\n\n---\n\n### 5. **What is the \"Mayor\"?**\n\nThe **Mayor** is the **Chief of Staff for cross-rig coordination** and the global coordinator for Gas Town:\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n- Receives escalations from Witnesses and Deacon\n- Coordinates work across multiple rigs and projects\n- Handles human communication when needed\n- Routes strategic decisions and cross-project issues\n- Primary interface between human Overseer and automated agents\n- When in doubt, escalate to the Mayor\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- Runs from the HQ root directory\n- Reads from CLAUDE.md (Mayor role context)\n- Has access to mayor/ config, state, and rig registry\n- Can be reached via \"mayor\" shortcut in mail/nudge addresses\n\n**Mayor Commands:**\n```bash\ngt mayor start                       # Start the Mayor session\ngt mayor status                      # Check Mayor session status\ngt mayor attach                      # Attach to Mayor session\ngt mayor restart                     # Restart Mayor session\ngt mayor stop                        # Stop Mayor session\n```\n\n**Mayor Context:**\n- Mayor has access to CLAUDE.md (AI instructions for Mayor)\n- mayor/ directory contains config, state, and rig registry\n- .beads/ contains town-level beads (hq-* prefix for Mayor mail)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary: The Agent Hierarchy**\n\nThe system has multiple types of agents working together:\n\n1. **Polecats** - Ephemeral workers (spawn for one task, then exit/nuke)\n2. **Witness** - Per-rig health monitor for polecats (watches for crashes, zombie states)\n3. **Deacon** - Town-level watchdog (monitors all Witnesses, manages Dogs)\n4. **Mayor** - Chief of Staff for cross-rig coordination (escalations, human interface)\n5. **Refinery** - Merge queue processor (handles code integration)\n6. **Dogs** - Cross-rig infrastructure workers (help Deacon with maintenance)\n7. **Crew** - Human persistent workspaces\n\n**The Propulsion Principle:** \"If it's on your hook, YOU RUN IT.\" - Work on a hook is guaranteed to survive and continue.\n\nThis creates a sophisticated system for coordinating multi-agent AI work across distributed projects with resilience, tracking, and human oversight built in."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":279,"cache_read_input_tokens":27586,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":279,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXJvewngGMbDoNacR1nHs","type":"assistant","uuid":"69b47564-1495-43e3-8765-48c0774eb650","timestamp":"2026-01-20T16:13:58.006Z"}
