  <section class="command-section" id="costs">
    <h2><code>gt costs</code></h2>
    <p class="command-description">Show costs for running Claude sessions [DISABLED]</p>
    <pre class="help-output">Display costs for Claude Code sessions in Gas Town.

⚠️  COST TRACKING IS CURRENTLY DISABLED

Claude Code displays costs in the TUI status bar, which cannot be captured
via tmux. All sessions will show $0.00 until Claude Code exposes cost data
through an API or environment variable.

What we need from Claude Code:
  - Stop hook env var (e.g., $CLAUDE_SESSION_COST)
  - Or queryable file/API endpoint

See: GH#24, gt-7awfj

The infrastructure remains in place and will work once cost data is available.

Examples:
  gt costs              # Live costs from running sessions
  gt costs --today      # Today's costs from wisps (not yet digested)
  gt costs --week       # This week's costs from digest beads + today's wisps
  gt costs --by-role    # Breakdown by role (polecat, witness, etc.)
  gt costs --by-rig     # Breakdown by rig
  gt costs --json       # Output as JSON

Subcommands:
  gt costs record       # Record session cost as ephemeral wisp (Stop hook)
  gt costs digest       # Aggregate wisps into daily digest bead (Deacon patrol)

Usage:
  gt costs [flags]
  gt costs [command]

Available Commands:
  digest      Aggregate session cost wisps into a daily digest bead
  migrate     Migrate legacy session.ended beads to the new wisp architecture
  record      Record session cost as an ephemeral wisp (called by Stop hook)

Flags:
      --by-rig    Show breakdown by rig
      --by-role   Show breakdown by role
  -h, --help      help for costs
      --json      Output as JSON
      --today     Show today's total from session events
  -v, --verbose   Show debug output for failures

  <section class="command-section" id="feed">
    <h2><code>gt feed</code></h2>
    <p class="command-description">Show real-time activity feed from beads and gt events</p>
    <pre class="help-output">Display a real-time feed of issue changes and agent activity.

By default, launches an interactive TUI dashboard with:
  - Agent tree (top): Shows all agents organized by role with latest activity
  - Convoy panel (middle): Shows in-progress and recently landed convoys
  - Event stream (bottom): Chronological feed you can scroll through
  - Vim-style navigation: j/k to scroll, tab to switch panels, 1/2/3 for panels, q to quit

The feed combines multiple event sources:
  - Beads activity: Issue creates, updates, completions (from bd activity)
  - GT events: Agent activity like patrol, sling, handoff (from .events.jsonl)
  - Convoy status: In-progress and recently-landed convoys (refreshes every 10s)

Use --plain for simple text output (wraps bd activity only).

Tmux Integration:
  Use --window to open the feed in a dedicated tmux window named 'feed'.
  This creates a persistent window you can cycle to with C-b n/p.

Event symbols:
  +  created/bonded    - New issue or molecule created
  →  in_progress       - Work started on an issue
  ✓  completed         - Issue closed or step completed
  ✗  failed            - Step or issue failed
  ⊘  deleted           - Issue removed
  🦉  patrol_started   - Witness began patrol cycle
  ⚡  polecat_nudged   - Worker was nudged
  🎯  sling            - Work was slung to worker
  🤝  handoff          - Session handed off

MQ (Merge Queue) event symbols:
  ⚙  merge_started   - Refinery began processing an MR
  ✓  merged          - MR successfully merged (green)
  ✗  merge_failed    - Merge failed (conflict, tests, etc.) (red)
  ⊘  merge_skipped   - MR skipped (already merged, etc.)

Examples:
  gt feed                       # Launch TUI dashboard
  gt feed --plain               # Plain text output (bd activity)
  gt feed --window              # Open in dedicated tmux window
  gt feed --since 1h            # Events from last hour
  gt feed --rig greenplace         # Use gastown rig's beads

      --mol string     Filter by molecule/issue ID prefix
      --no-follow      Show events once and exit
      --plain          Use plain text output (bd activity) instead of TUI
      --rig string     Run from specific rig's beads directory
      --since string   Show events since duration (e.g., 5m, 1h, 30s)
      --type string    Filter by event type (create, update, delete, comment)
  -w, --window         Open in dedicated tmux window (creates 'feed' window)

  <section class="command-section" id="patrol">
    <h2><code>gt patrol</code></h2>
    <p class="command-description">Patrol digest management</p>
    <pre class="help-output">Manage patrol cycle digests.

Patrol cycles (Deacon, Witness, Refinery) create ephemeral per-cycle digests
to avoid JSONL pollution. This command aggregates them into daily summaries.

Examples:
  gt patrol digest --yesterday  # Aggregate yesterday's patrol digests
  gt patrol digest --dry-run    # Preview what would be aggregated

Usage:
  gt patrol [command]

Available Commands:
  digest      Aggregate patrol cycle digests into a daily summary bead

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for patrol

Use &quot;gt patrol [command] --help&quot; for more information about a command.
</pre>
  </section>

  <section class="command-section" id="prime">
    <h2><code>gt prime</code></h2>
    <p class="command-description">Output role context for current directory</p>
    <pre class="help-output">Detect the agent role from the current directory and output context.

Role detection:
  - Town root, mayor/, or &lt;rig&gt;/mayor/ → Mayor context
  - &lt;rig&gt;/witness/rig/ → Witness context
  - &lt;rig&gt;/refinery/rig/ → Refinery context
  - &lt;rig&gt;/polecats/&lt;name&gt;/ → Polecat context

This command is typically used in shell prompts or agent initialization.

HOOK MODE (--hook):
  When called as an LLM runtime hook, use --hook to enable session ID handling.
  This reads session metadata from stdin and persists it for the session.

  Claude Code integration (in .claude/settings.json):
    &quot;SessionStart&quot;: [&#123;&quot;hooks&quot;: [&#123;&quot;type&quot;: &quot;command&quot;, &quot;command&quot;: &quot;gt prime --hook&quot;&#125;]&#125;]

  Claude Code sends JSON on stdin:
    &#123;&quot;session_id&quot;: &quot;uuid&quot;, &quot;transcript_path&quot;: &quot;/path&quot;, &quot;source&quot;: &quot;startup|resume&quot;&#125;

  Other agents can set GT_SESSION_ID environment variable instead.

Usage:
  gt prime [flags]

Flags:
      --dry-run   Show what would be injected without side effects (no marker removal, no bd prime, no mail)
      --explain   Show why each section was included
  -h, --help      help for prime
      --hook      Hook mode: read session ID from stdin JSON (for LLM runtime hooks)
      --json      Output state as JSON (requires --state)
      --state     Show detected session state only (normal/post-handoff/crash/autonomous)
</pre>

  <section class="command-section" id="seance">
    <h2><code>gt seance</code></h2>
    <p class="command-description">Talk to your predecessor sessions</p>
    <pre class="help-output">Seance lets you literally talk to predecessor sessions.

&quot;Where did you put the stuff you left for me?&quot; - The #1 handoff question.

Instead of parsing logs, seance spawns a Claude subprocess that resumes
a predecessor session with full context. You can ask questions directly:
  - &quot;Why did you make this decision?&quot;
  - &quot;Where were you stuck?&quot;
  - &quot;What did you try that didn't work?&quot;

DISCOVERY:
  gt seance                     # List recent sessions from events
  gt seance --role crew         # Filter by role type
  gt seance --rig gastown       # Filter by rig
  gt seance --recent 10         # Last N sessions

THE SEANCE (talk to predecessor):
  gt seance --talk &lt;session-id&gt;              # Interactive conversation
  gt seance --talk &lt;id&gt; -p &quot;Where is X?&quot;     # One-shot question

The --talk flag spawns: claude --fork-session --resume &lt;id&gt;
This loads the predecessor's full context without modifying their session.

Sessions are discovered from:
  1. Events emitted by SessionStart hooks (~/gt/.events.jsonl)
  2. The [GAS TOWN] beacon makes sessions searchable in /resume

Usage:
  gt seance [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help            help for seance
      --json            Output as JSON
  -p, --prompt string   One-shot prompt (with --talk)
  -n, --recent int      Number of recent sessions to show (default 20)
      --rig string      Filter by rig name
      --role string     Filter by role (crew, polecat, witness, etc.)
  -t, --talk string     Session ID to commune with
</pre>

  <section class="command-section" id="stale">
    <h2><code>gt stale</code></h2>
    <p class="command-description">Check if the gt binary is stale</p>
    <pre class="help-output">Check if the gt binary was built from an older commit than the current repo HEAD.

This command compares the commit hash embedded in the binary at build time
with the current HEAD of the gastown repository.

Examples:
  gt stale              # Human-readable output
  gt stale --json       # Machine-readable JSON output
  gt stale --quiet      # Exit code only (0=stale, 1=fresh)
