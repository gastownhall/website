const content = "<p>\nGas Town is an agentic development environment for managing multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously using the <code>gt</code> and <code>bd</code> (Beads) binaries, coordinated with tmux in git-managed directories.\n</p>\n<h2>Core Principles</h2>\n<h3>MEOW (Molecular Expression of Work)</h3>\n<p>\nBreaking large goals into detailed instructions for agents. Supported by Beads, Epics, Formulas, and Molecules. MEOW ensures work is decomposed into trackable, atomic units that agents can execute autonomously.\n</p>\n<h3>GUPP (Gas Town Universal Propulsion Principle)</h3>\n<p>\n\"If there is work on your Hook, YOU MUST RUN IT.\" This principle ensures agents autonomously proceed with available work without waiting for external input. GUPP is the heartbeat of autonomous operation.\n</p>\n<h3>NDI (Nondeterministic Idempotence)</h3>\n<p>\nThe overarching goal ensuring useful outcomes through orchestration of potentially unreliable processes. Persistent Beads and oversight agents (Witness, Deacon) guarantee eventual workflow completion even when individual operations may fail or produce varying results.\n</p>\n<h2>Environments</h2>\n<h3>Town</h3>\n<p>\nThe management headquarters (e.g., <code>~/gt/</code>). The Town coordinates all workers across multiple Rigs and houses town-level agents like Mayor and Deacon.\n</p>\n<h3>Rig</h3>\n<p>\nA project-specific Git repository under Gas Town management. Each Rig has its own Polecats, Refinery, Witness, and Crew members. Rigs are where actual development work happens.\n</p>\n<h2>Town-Level Roles</h2>\n<h3>Mayor</h3>\n<p>\nChief-of-staff agent responsible for initiating Convoys, coordinating work distribution, and notifying users of important events. The Mayor operates from the town level and has visibility across all Rigs.\n</p>\n<h3>Deacon</h3>\n<p>\nDaemon beacon running continuous Patrol cycles. The Deacon ensures worker activity, monitors system health, and triggers recovery when agents become unresponsive. Think of the Deacon as the system's watchdog.\n</p>\n<h3>Dogs</h3>\n<p>\nThe Deacon's crew of maintenance agents handling background tasks like cleanup, health checks, and system maintenance.\n</p>\n<h3>Boot (the Dog)</h3>\n<p>\nA special Dog that checks the Deacon every 5 minutes, ensuring the watchdog itself is still watching. This creates a chain of accountability.\n</p>\n<h2>Rig-Level Roles</h2>\n<h3>Polecat</h3>\n<p>\nEphemeral worker agents that produce Merge Requests. Polecats are spawned for specific tasks, complete their work, and are then cleaned up. They work in isolated git worktrees to avoid conflicts.\n</p>\n<h3>Refinery</h3>\n<p>\nManages the Merge Queue for a Rig. The Refinery intelligently merges changes from Polecats, handling conflicts and ensuring code quality before changes reach the main branch.\n</p>\n<h3>Witness</h3>\n<p>\nPatrol agent that oversees Polecats and the Refinery within a Rig. The Witness monitors progress, detects stuck agents, and can trigger recovery actions.\n</p>\n<h3>Crew</h3>\n<p>\nLong-lived, named agents for persistent collaboration. Unlike ephemeral Polecats, Crew members maintain context across sessions and are ideal for ongoing work relationships.\n</p>\n<h2>Work Units</h2>\n<h3>Bead</h3>\n<p>\nGit-backed atomic work unit stored in JSONL format. Beads are the fundamental unit of work tracking in Gas Town. They can represent issues, tasks, epics, or any trackable work item.\n</p>\n<h3>Formula</h3>\n<p>\nTOML-based workflow source template. Formulas define reusable patterns for common operations like patrol cycles, code review, or deployment.\n</p>\n<h3>Protomolecule</h3>\n<p>\nA template class for instantiating Molecules. Protomolecules define the structure and steps of a workflow without being tied to specific work items.\n</p>\n<h3>Molecule</h3>\n<p>\nDurable chained Bead workflows. Molecules represent multi-step processes where each step is tracked as a Bead. They survive agent restarts and ensure complex workflows complete.\n</p>\n<h3>Wisp</h3>\n<p>\nEphemeral Beads destroyed after runs. Wisps are lightweight work items used for transient operations that don't need permanent tracking.\n</p>\n<h3>Hook</h3>\n<p>\nA special pinned Bead for each agent. The Hook is an agent's primary work queue - when work appears on your Hook, GUPP dictates you must run it.\n</p>\n<h2>Workflow Commands</h2>\n<h3>Convoy</h3>\n<p>\nPrimary work-order wrapping related Beads. Convoys group related tasks together and can be assigned to multiple workers. Created with <code>gt convoy create</code>.\n</p>\n<h3>Slinging</h3>\n<p>\nAssigning work to agents via <code>gt sling</code>. When you sling work to a Polecat or Crew member, you're putting it on their Hook for execution.\n</p>\n<h3>Nudging</h3>\n<p>\nReal-time messaging between agents with <code>gt nudge</code>. Nudges allow immediate communication without going through the mail system.\n</p>\n<h3>Handoff</h3>\n<p>\nAgent session refresh via <code>/handoff</code>. When context gets full or an agent needs a fresh start, handoff transfers work state to a new session.\n</p>\n<h3>Seance</h3>\n<p>\nCommunicating with previous sessions via <code>gt seance</code>. Allows agents to query their predecessors for context and decisions from earlier work.\n</p>\n<h3>Patrol</h3>\n<p>\nEphemeral loop maintaining system heartbeat. Patrol agents (Deacon, Witness) continuously cycle through health checks and trigger actions as needed.\n</p>\n<p>\n---\n</p>\n<em>This glossary was contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/cshirky\">Clay Shirky</a> in <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown/issues/80\">Issue #80</a>.</em>";
