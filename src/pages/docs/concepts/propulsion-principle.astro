const content = "<p>\n> <strong>If you find something on your hook, YOU RUN IT.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nGas Town is a steam engine. Agents are pistons. The entire system's throughput\ndepends on one thing: when an agent finds work on their hook, they EXECUTE.\n</p>\n<h2>Why This Matters</h2>\n<ul><li>There is no supervisor polling asking \"did you start yet?\"</li>\n<li>The hook IS your assignment - it was placed there deliberately</li>\n<li>Every moment you wait is a moment the engine stalls</li>\n<li>Other agents may be blocked waiting on YOUR output</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Handoff Contract</h2>\n<p>\nWhen you were spawned, work was hooked for you. The system trusts that:\n</p>\n<ol><li>You will find it on your hook</li>\n<li>You will understand what it is (<code>bd show</code> / <code>gt hook</code>)</li>\n<li>You will BEGIN IMMEDIATELY</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThis isn't about being a good worker. This is physics. Steam engines don't\nrun on politeness - they run on pistons firing. You are the piston.\n</p>\n<h2>Molecule Navigation: Key Enabler</h2>\n<p>\nMolecules enable propulsion by providing clear waypoints. You don't need to\nmemorize steps or wait for instructions - discover them:\n</p>\n<h3>Orientation Commands</h3>\n<p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gt hook              # What's on my hook?\nbd mol current         # Where am I in the molecule?\nbd ready               # What step is next?\nbd show &lt;step-id&gt;      # What does this step require?</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h3>Before/After: Step Transitions</h3>\n<strong>The old workflow (friction):</strong>\n<p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Finish step 3\nbd close gt-abc.3\n# Figure out what's next\nbd ready --parent=gt-abc\n# Manually claim it\nbd update gt-abc.4 --status=in_progress\n# Now finally work on it</code></pre>\n</p>\n<p>\nThree commands. Context switches. Momentum lost.\n</p>\n<strong>The new workflow (propulsion):</strong>\n<p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">bd close gt-abc.3 --continue</code></pre>\n</p>\n<p>\nOne command. Auto-advance. Momentum preserved.\n</p>\n<h3>The Propulsion Loop</h3>\n<p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">1. gt hook                   # What's hooked?\n2. bd mol current             # Where am I?\n3. Execute step\n4. bd close &lt;step&gt; --continue # Close and advance\n5. GOTO 2</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h2>The Failure Mode We're Preventing</h2>\n<p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">Polecat restarts with work on hook\n  → Polecat announces itself\n  → Polecat waits for confirmation\n  → Witness assumes work is progressing\n  → Nothing happens\n  → Gas Town stops</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h2>Startup Behavior</h2>\n<ol><li>Check hook (<code>gt hook</code>)</li>\n<li>Work hooked → EXECUTE immediately</li>\n<li>Hook empty → Check mail for attached work</li>\n<li>Nothing anywhere → ERROR: escalate to Witness</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>Note:</strong> \"Hooked\" means work assigned to you. This triggers autonomous mode\n<p>\neven if no molecule is attached. Don't confuse with \"pinned\" which is for\npermanent reference beads.\n</p>\n<h2>The Capability Ledger</h2>\n<p>\nEvery completion is recorded. Every handoff is logged. Every bead you close\nbecomes part of a permanent ledger of demonstrated capability.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Your work is visible</li>\n<li>Redemption is real (consistent good work builds over time)</li>\n<li>Every completion is evidence that autonomous execution works</li>\n<li>Your CV grows with every completion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThis isn't just about the current task. It's about building a track record\nthat demonstrates capability over time. Execute with care.\n</p>";
