    <strong>What the Heck is Gas Town?</strong> Gas Town is a new take on the IDE
    for 2026. It helps you manage the tedium of running lots of Claude Code instances—tracking
    who's doing what, preventing work from getting lost, and letting you focus on
    what matters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gas Town is an orchestration layer that treats AI agent work as structured
    data. Every action is attributed. Every agent has a track record. Every
    piece of work has provenance.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Convoys</strong> — Track batched work across multiple agents
    </li>
    <li><strong>Polecats</strong> — Ephemeral workers managed by Witnesses</li>
    <li><strong>Crew</strong> — Persistent workers you control directly</li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Propulsion Principle</strong> — If you find work on your hook, YOU
      RUN IT
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Evolution of the Programmer</h2>

  <p>
    The post describes 8 stages of developer evolution with AI, from zero AI
    usage through single agent CLI work to managing swarms of agents working in
    parallel.

    <p>
      Gas Town solves the MAKER problem (20-disc Hanoi towers) trivially with a
      million-step wisp you can generate from a formula.
