    Three days after launching Gas Town, this post shares the backstory and
    makes predictions about what will happen to IDEs, big companies, and coding
    agents themselves in 2026.
  </p>

  <h2>Gas Town Today</h2>

  <p>
    Gas Town works pretty OK today—super fast, very fun, very powerful,
    definitely sloppy. But it will get dramatically more capable as four
    evolving situations unfold around tooling and model intelligence.
  </p>

  <h2>Predictions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The future of IDEs and how they'll adapt to agent-first workflows</li>
    <li>How big companies will respond to the agent revolution</li>
    <li>The evolution of coding agents themselves</li>
    <li>Real-world examples of using Gas Town for production work</li>
  </ul>
