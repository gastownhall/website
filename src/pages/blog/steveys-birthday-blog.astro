    A birthday reflection (turning fifty-seven on Jan 20th) on being in the best physical
    shape of your life while cranking out thousands of lines of production code per day,
    chatting with brilliant friends around the world, and generally having an absolute blast.

  <h2>Five Themes</h2>

  <p>The post explores five themes shaping 2026:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Money</strong> — The world's money is sloshing around, trying to get into AI</li>
    <li><strong>Time</strong> — The acceleration of development and change</li>
    <li><strong>Power</strong> — How AI is reshaping who has leverage</li>
    <li><strong>Control</strong> — Managing complexity at scale</li>
    <li><strong>Direction</strong> — Where this is all heading</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    <p>2026 is shaping up to be straight-up insane. There's a lot going on, and it's speeding up.</p>
